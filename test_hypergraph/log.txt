The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation: Game step #2


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You're now in the living room.

You see a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

Observation: Game step #9


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bed. The bed is large. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly bed, silly, empty, good for nothing bed.

There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west.

You see a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
