You arrive in a Bathroom. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you can see a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You can see a bathroom sink. On the bathroom sink you can see a toothbrush and a deodorant. What's that over there? It looks like it's a towel rack. The towel rack is typical. On the towel rack you can make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

On the study table you can see a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kids bed. The kids bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Kids Room.

You make out a toy storage cabinet. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy car and a toy sword. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a study table. You see a school notebooks, a felt tip pens and a dumbbell on the study table. You scan the room, seeing a kids bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it.

You arrive in a Bathroom. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you can see a toilet paper. You can see a bathroom sink. On the bathroom sink you can see a deodorant and a toothbrush. What's that over there? It looks like it's a towel rack. The towel rack is typical. On the towel rack you can make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a study table. You see a felt tip pens and a school notebooks on the study table. You scan the room, seeing a kids bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

Observation: 

-= Swimming Pool Area =-
You are in a Swimming Pool Area. It seems to be pretty usual here. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a pool equipment rack. You see a swimming fins, a swimming goggles and a life ring on the pool equipment rack. You make out a table for pool chemicals. On the table for pool chemicals you can make out a chlorine.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Gym =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a Gym.

You see a locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is standard. On the dumbbell stand you can make out a dumbbell. You see a treadmill. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Observation:

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Observation: 

-= Kids Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Kids Room.

You make out a toy storage cabinet. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy car and a toy sword. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a study table. You see a school notebooks, a felt tip pens and a dumbbell on the study table. You scan the room, seeing a kids bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Observation: 

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a Bathroom. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you can see a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You can see a bathroom sink. On the bathroom sink you can see a toothbrush and a deodorant. What's that over there? It looks like it's a towel rack. The towel rack is typical. On the towel rack you can make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. On the cook table you make out a dirty plate.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a study table. You see a school notebooks and a felt tip pens on the study table. You scan the room, seeing a kids bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Kids Room.

You make out a toy storage cabinet. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy car and a toy sword. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a study table. You see a school notebooks and a felt tip pens on the study table. You scan the room, seeing a kids bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nYou don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north.
