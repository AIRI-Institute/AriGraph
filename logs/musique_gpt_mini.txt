EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Jack Cohen (March 21, 1919, Brooklyn – April 16, 2012, Jerusalem) was an American Reconstructionist rabbi, educator, philosopher and author. Cohen held a PhD from Columbia University in the philosophy of education. In 1943 he was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) and, soon after, started to teach courses there. Cohen was one of the distinguished students of Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Movement, and was one of the founders of Kehillat Mevakshei Derech, a synagogue in Israel. Rabbi Dr. Jack Cohen was Honorary Chairman at Kaplan Center for Jewish Peoplehood and director of the Hillel Foundation at the Hebrew University for 23 years.', 'Derech Mitzvosecha, also titled Sefer Hamitzvos (), is an interpretive work on the Jewish commandments authored by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789–1866), the third Rebbe of the Chabad Hasidic movement. The work is considered a fundamental text of Chabad philosophy.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The creator of Derech Mitzvosecha is Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, who was the third Rebbe of the Chabad Hasidic movement. The movement itself has a lineage of leaders, where Rabbi Schneersohn would have followed the traditions and teachings established by his predecessors in the Chabad movement. However, the question is specifically about whom he followed directly in terms of influence or educational mentorship. From the information provided, it does not specify a singular figure that Rabbi Schneersohn followed directly, so I will consider that he was likely influenced by the teachings of earlier Chabad leaders such as Rabbi Dovber Schneuri (his grandfather). 

Direct answer: Rabbi Dovber Schneuri
TRUE ANSWER: Dovber Schneuri

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Boston Celtics center Bill Russell holds the record for the most NBA championships won with 11 titles during his 13 - year playing career. He won his first championship with the Boston Celtics in his rookie year. Afterwards, he went on to win 10 championships in the next 12 years, including eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. He won the last two championships in 1968 and 1969 as player - coach. Russell's teammate, Sam Jones, won 10 championships from 1959 to 1969, the second most in NBA history. Four Celtics players, Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Satch Sanders and John Havlicek, won eight championships each. Two other Celtics, Jim Loscutoff and Frank Ramsey, won seven championships each. Four players, Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul - Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, won six championships each. Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s. George Mikan won 2 championships in the NBL before it merged with the BAA to form the NBA, and won 5 championships in the NBA.", "The NBA draft is an annual event dating back to 1947 in which the (now thirty) teams from the National Basketball Association (NBA) can draft players who are eligible and wish to join the league. These are typically college basketball players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. College players who have finished their four - year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 22 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called ``early - entrants ''or`` early - entry candidates''. The draft usually takes place at the end of June, during the NBA offseason. Since 1989, the draft has consisted of two rounds; this is much shorter than the entry drafts of the other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, all of which run at least seven rounds. Sixty players are selected in each draft. No player may sign with the NBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to determine which team drafted the winner of the NBA scoring title for this year. However, I do not have specific information about the current year's NBA scoring title winner or the team that drafted them, as my knowledge is up to October 2023 and the relevant facts do not contain this information. Therefore, I am unable to provide a direct answer based on the information available to me.
Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Big Bamboo is the eighth novel by Tim Dorsey featuring the sociopathic anti-hero Serge A. Storms. It was published in the USA in March 2006 and May 2006 in the UK. The plotline follows Serge A. Storms as he follows his recent obsession of Hollywood and movies, in particular the movie "The Punisher", which was shot on location in Florida. Serge travels to Hollywood to write a screenplay, something that Coleman, his constantly addled companion, is constantly interrupting with obnoxious and sometimes outrageous concerns.', 'Bamboo Among the Oaks is the first Hmong American anthology of creative writing, published in 2002 by the Minnesota Historical Society Press. Many of the pieces contained in "Bamboo Among The Oaks" first appeared in the "Paj Ntaub Voice" Hmoob literary journal.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The book "Bamboo Among the Oaks" was published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press. I recall that the name of the publisher suggests it is associated with Minnesota. Researching or recalling the specific headquarters location of the Minnesota Historical Society would indicate its geographic location. Therefore, I conclude that the headquarters of the publisher is in Minnesota.

The children were usually made to look like the original performers, including clothing and make-up. Controversy over children singing songs that often contained a subtext of adult content (in adult costumes and make-up) led to the show's cancellation after one series.", 'Closer is the second studio album by vocalist Josh Groban, released in November 2003.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Lord of the Rings is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). They are a New Zealand - American venture produced by WingNut Films and The Saul Zaentz Company and distributed by New Line Cinema.', "New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The first to import slaves to New York were the Dutch in the early 17th century, specifically in 1626. The country where "The Lord of the Rings" was filmed is New Zealand. The Dutch explorers who first visited New Zealand did so in the early 17th century as well, with Abel Tasman landing there in 1642. Therefore, the Dutch who imported slaves to New York did so before the country where "The Lord of the Rings" was filmed was discovered.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Beginning with its incorporation in 1802, Detroit has had a total of 74 mayors. Detroit's last mayor from the Republican Party was Louis Miriani, who served from 1957 to 1962. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, Coleman Young. Despite development efforts, his combative style during his five terms in office was not well received by many suburban residents. Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court Justice, refocused the city's attention on redevelopment with a plan to permit three casinos downtown. By 2008, three major casino resort hotels established operations in the city.", 'Hardin Bigelow (1809 in Michigan Territory – November 27, 1850 in San Francisco, California) was the first elected mayor of the city of Sacramento, California, which was known then as "Sacramento City." Bigelow\'s efforts to construct Sacramento\'s first levees won him enough support to become mayor in Sacramento\'s first mayoral elections in February 1850. Bigelow served seven months, from April to November, before succumbing to cholera; while he was mayor, Sacramento averted disaster in a potentially devastating flood, but fell victim to a series of April fires, a riot, and a cholera epidemic.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The headquarters of Barton Premium Blend's manufacturer, Sazerac Company, is located in New Orleans. New Orleans elected its first black mayor, who was Ray Nagin, in 2002. However, according to the relevant information, the first black mayor was elected in the 1970s, specifically in context with Detroit. The question is asking about New Orleans, and I confirmed that New Orleans elected its first black mayor in 2002, which is a confirmed and concrete fact from my memory.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Saban Capital Group and Lionsgate announced the film in May 2014, with Roberto Orci originally attached to produce. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz were hired to write the film\'s script. Orci eventually left the project to work on Star Trek Beyond. On April 10, 2015, TheWrap reported that Dean Israelite was in negotiations to direct the film. Israelite told IGN in an interview that the film would be "completely playful, and it needs to be really fun and funny. But like Project Almanac, it\'s going to feel very grounded at the same time, and very contemporary and have a real edge to it, and a real gut to it, it\'s going to be a fun, joyful [movie] but one that feels completely grounded in a real world, with real characters going through real things". Brian Tyler was brought on to compose the film\'s music. Israelite has said that the film updates itself from the original series, being more character-driven and incorporating naturalism and a grounded nature.', "Essie Ackland toured Australia in 1937, by which time she was considered the most recorded contralto in the world. For her first Sydney concert on 13 March 1937, the demand for seats outstripped the Conservatorium's capacity, so the concert was moved to the Sydney Town Hall. She was accompanied by the violinist Ernest Llewellyn and the pianist Raymond Lambert. She toured her native land for four months, and a further two months in New Zealand. During World War II she sang over 1,300 times in hospitals, air raid shelters, army camps and factories throughout Great Britain, and entertained Australian soldiers at her London home."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: First, we need to identify the artist whose concert was the first Beyoncé attended. According to the facts, this concert featured Michael Jackson. Next, we look for the movie based on Michael Jackson and the singer of "Is She Really Going Out With Him," which was played by Joe Jackson. 

Direct answer: Joe Jackson

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the Vital Records Office of the states, capital district, territories and former territories. Birth in the U.S. establishes automatic eligibility for American citizenship, so a birth certificate from a local authority is commonly provided to the federal government to obtain a U.S. passport. However, the U.S. State Department does issue a Consular Report of Birth Abroad for children born to U.S. citizens (who are also eligible for citizenship), including births on military bases in foreign territory.', 'The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against Germany, Italy, Japan and starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained formal neutrality as made officially in the Quarantine Speech delivered by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937, while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war material through the Lend - Lease Act which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion forces in Iceland. In the Pacific Theater, there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such as the Flying Tigers. The U.S. economic sanctions on Japan, as part of the effort to deter Japanese military aggression in Asia and the Pacific, was a major cause of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Pao Sarasin was born in Thailand. The U.S. believed that Thailand was occupied by Japanese troops and was forced into actions by Japanese blackmail, which led to the country's cooperation with Japan during World War II. This indicates that external pressures and military occupation were significant factors in Thailand's alignment with Japan. 

Direct answer: The U.S. believes that Thailand was forced into actions by Japanese blackmail, causing it to help Japan.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhD programs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists. All of the departments in the College of Science offer PhD programs, except for the Department of Pre-Professional Studies. The School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture, while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhD programs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs including MBA and Master of Science in Accountancy programs. It also operates facilities in Chicago and Cincinnati for its executive MBA program. Additionally, the Alliance for Catholic Education program offers a Master of Education program where students study at the university during the summer and teach in Catholic elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools across the Southern United States for two school years.', 'Various scientists and engineers contributed to the development of internal combustion engines. In 1791 2, John Barber developed a turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use liquid fuel (gasoline), and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, French engineers Nicéphore (who went on to invent photography) and Claude Niépce ran a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyréolophore. This engine powered a boat on the Saône river, France. The same year, the Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built an internal combustion engine ignited by electric spark. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The creator of the Lap Engine is James Watt. Notably, it is mentioned that James Watt worked at the University of Glasgow. However, it is not explicitly clear if that was his primary education or if he attended other institutions before that. The question directly asks where he was educated, and the reference to his employment does not clarify the complete educational history. Therefore, it's safest to conclude that I have no definitive answer as the information available does not specify where he was educated apart from his later work.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The revival began with Jonathan Edwards in Northampton, Massachusetts. Edwards came from Puritan, Calvinist roots, but emphasized the importance and power of immediate, personal religious experience. Religious experience had to be immediate, he taught. He distrusted hierarchy and catechisms. His sermons were ``solemn, with a distinct and careful enunciation, and a slow cadence. ''His sermons were powerful and attracted a large following. Anglican preacher George Whitefield visited from England; he continued the movement, traveling throughout the colonies and preaching in a more dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone into his audiences. Both Edwards and Whitefield were slave owners and believed that blacks would acquire absolute equality with whites in the Millennial church.", 'The English Church was brought back under papal authority in 1553 and doctrinal and liturgical conformity at the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary I. The restoration of papal authority was celebrated by the majority of the nation and enforced by the Marian persecutions against Protestants. Her harshness was a success but at the cost of alienating a fairly large section of English society which had been moving away from some traditional Catholic devotional practices. The English it seems were quite caught up with the reforming movement on the Continent. At the time they were neither Calvinist nor Lutheran, but certainly leaning toward Protestantism (and by the late 16th century, were certainly Protestant).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Egidio Vagnozzi was a cardinal in the Catholic Church, and his focus was on reforming the institution behind the Catholic faith. However, the relevant information regarding his sermons does not specify a state. The associated facts don't provide enough context about his preaching locations to pinpoint a specific state. Therefore, I must conclude that there is not enough information to determine the state in which he preached.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: To answer the question, I need to identify a player who has played for West Ham, Ajax, and a team from the city where Malcolm Graham died. Having reviewed the facts, it appears that Hines fits the criteria as he played for West Ham United and has connections to the club working there in youth development. However, I do not have any specific information indicating Hines' time at Ajax or the city where Malcolm Graham died. Therefore, without identifying a specific player who meets all criteria, it is best to conclude I do not have enough information.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.", 'Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The arguer that Yuri Bogatyryov's country of citizenship had become an imperialist power is Mao Zedong, who expressed intentions regarding intervention in Korea during meetings with Chinese leadership. His involvement was aligned with the context of Chinese support for North Korea during the conflict. Therefore, the specific location indicated for intervention in the Korean conflict by Mao was in relation to Korea itself.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['However, the 18th century saw the European empires gradually expand across the world, as European states developed economies built on maritime trade. The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state to state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in nearby India and on the islands that are now Indonesia. The Qing response, successful for a time, was in 1756 to establish the Canton System, which restricted maritime trade to that city and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their governments.', 'The U.S. Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, following the House which passed a bill in December 2009. These bills must now be reconciled. The New York Times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the Obama administration. For instance, the Volcker Rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation, though in the Senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant information indicates that the U.S. House passed a bill in December 2009, and the Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, which included provisions about regulators' discretion to prohibit proprietary trades. The party that controlled the House of Representatives during this time was the Democrats, as indicated by the mention of five Democratic incumbents being defeated in the 2014 elections which gave control to the Republicans. Therefore, the control of the House of Representatives in December 2009 was held by the Democrats before the Republicans gained control of both houses in 2014.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Hokkien dialects are analytic; in a sentence, the arrangement of words is important to its meaning. A basic sentence follows the subject–verb–object pattern (i.e. a subject is followed by a verb then by an object), though this order is often violated because Hokkien dialects are topic-prominent. Unlike synthetic languages, seldom do words indicate time, gender and plural by inflection. Instead, these concepts are expressed through adverbs, aspect markers, and grammatical particles, or are deduced from the context. Different particles are added to a sentence to further specify its status or intonation.', 'The tournament was won by host country France, who beat defending champions Brazil 3 -- 0 in the final. France won their first title, becoming the seventh nation to win a World Cup, and the sixth (after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina) to win the tournament on home soil. Croatia, Jamaica, Japan and South Africa made their first appearances in the finals.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: To answer the question, we need to identify the countries involved. The country that hosted the tournament is France, while A Don is located in Sekong Province, Myanmar. The natural boundary between France and Myanmar would be through neighboring countries. It's known that the Hoklo people brought the Hokkien language to Southeast Asia. They are ethnic Han Chinese from Southern Fujian, China, which is geographically relevant to Myanmar. Therefore, the Hoklo brought the Hokkien language to Myanmar, the country where A Don is located.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated "Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry", as both groups – the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews – shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen. Atzmon\'s team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.', 'People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city, making up 15.8% of the population, followed by Italians, accounting for 8.3% of the population. People of West Indian and Caribbean ancestry are another sizable group, at 6.0%, about half of whom are of Haitian ancestry. Over 27,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Boston city proper in 2013, and the city hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown, Manhattan. Some neighborhoods, such as Dorchester, have received an influx of people of Vietnamese ancestry in recent decades. Neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing number of Dominican Americans. The city and greater area also has a growing immigrant population of South Asians, including the tenth-largest Indian community in the country.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Given that the study mentions inter-marriage and conversions as possible factors for genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and modern-day Italians, it implies that similar social dynamics may occur with the second largest ethnic group, which is Italians in this context. Therefore, inter-marriage between Jews and Italians and historical social interactions could lead to genetic similarities. Additionally, the shared historical and geographical proximity, along with cultural exchanges over centuries, might contribute to genetic overlap. 
Direct answer: Inter-marriage and historical interactions.
TRUE ANSWER: inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The religious data on India Census 2011 was released by the Government of India on 25 August 2015. Hindus are 79.8% (966.3 million), while Muslims are 14.23% (172.2 million) in India. and Christians are 2.30% (28.7 million). According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India. For the first time, a ``No religion ''category was added in the 2011 census. 2.87 million were classified as people belonging to`` No Religion'' in India in the 2011 census 0.24% of India's population of 1.21 billion. Given below is the decade - by - decade religious composition of India until the 2011 census. There are six religions in India that have been awarded ``National Minority ''status - Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis. Sunnis, Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and Ahmadiyyas were identified as sects of Islam in India. As per 2011 census, six major faiths - Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains make up over 99.4% of India's 1.21 billion population, while`` other religions, persuasions'' (ORP) count is 8.2 million. Among the ORP faiths, six faiths - 4.957 million - strong Sarnaism, 1.026 million - strong Gond, 506,000 - strong Sari, Donyi - Polo (302,000) in Arunachal Pradesh, Sanamahism (222,000) in Manipur, Khasi (138,000) in Meghalaya dominate. Maharashtra is having the highest number of atheists in the country with 9,652 such people, followed by Kerala.", "The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduvān (Hindus) and hindavī was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The majority religion in the area of British India that became India is Hinduism. The Arabic equivalent for the term India is Al-Hind, but the term for Hinduism in Arabic is هندوسية (Hinduism). Therefore, the relevant Arabic word for Hinduism would pertain to the majority religion in that context.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Despite the fact that humans have occupied the territory of Portugal for thousands of years, something still remains of the original vegetation. In Gerês both deciduous and coniferous forests can be found, an extremely rare worldwide mature mediterranean forest remain in some parts of the Arrábida mountain and a subtropical laurissilva forest, dating back to the Tertiary period, covers its largest continuous area in the world in the Madeira main island. Due to the human population decrease and rural exodus, Pyrenean oak and other local native trees are colonizing many abandoned areas. Boar, Iberian red deer, roe deer, Iberian wild goat, for example, are reported to be expanding greatly, during the last decades. Boars were found recently roaming at night inside large urban areas, like in Setubal. Protected areas of Portugal include one national park (Portuguese: Parque Nacional), 12 natural parks (Portuguese: Parque Natural), nine natural reserves (Portuguese: Reserva Natural), five natural monuments (Portuguese: Monumento Natural), and seven protected landscapes (Portuguese: Paisagem Protegida), which include the Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, the Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela and the Paul d'Arzila.", 'Russia was announced as the hosts on 2 December 2010 after the country was awarded the hosting rights of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played in four different stadiums across four cities: Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, and Sochi. It was the first time Russia has hosted the tournament, and the third time the Confederations Cup has been held in the European continent. As hosts, Russia qualified automatically for the tournament; they were joined by the six winners of the FIFA confederation championships and the 2014 FIFA World Cup champions, Germany.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Russia was announced as the hosts on 2 December 2010 after the country was awarded the hosting rights of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played in four different stadiums across four cities: Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, and Sochi. It was the first time Russia has hosted the tournament, and the third time the Confederations Cup has been held in the European continent. As hosts, Russia qualified automatically for the tournament; they were joined by the six winners of the FIFA confederation championships and the 2014 FIFA World Cup champions, Germany.', 'The 1986 FIFA World Cup, the 13th FIFA World Cup, was held in Mexico from 31 May to 29 June 1986. The tournament was the second to feature a 24 - team format. With European nations not allowed to host after the previous World Cup in Spain, Colombia had been originally chosen to host the competition by FIFA but, largely due to economic reasons, was not able to do so and officially resigned in 1982. Mexico was selected as the new host in May 1983. This was the third FIFA World Cup tournament in succession that was hosted by a Hispanophonic country, after Spain in 1982, and Argentina in 1978.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The country that hosted the tournament is Russia, which hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The country where A Don is located is Laos. The relevant information indicates that the Portuguese were expelled from Mozambique, with the Dutch helping in that expulsion. However, the text does not provide specific details on how the expulsion occurred or if it is directly related to the natural boundary between Russia and Laos. Therefore, there is insufficient information to clearly describe the expulsion process in the context requested.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Other states with long histories of no death penalty include Wisconsin (the only state with only one execution), Rhode Island (although later reintroduced, it was unused and abolished again), Maine, North Dakota, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Vermont. The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty; it was last used in 1957. Oregon abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings.', "Coles Creek (also known as Cole's Creek) is a tributary of Fishing Creek, in Columbia County, Pennsylvania and Sullivan County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is long and is the first named tributary of Fishing Creek downstream of where East Branch Fishing Creek and West Branch Fishing Creek meet to form Fishing Creek. The creek is on the edge of Columbia County and parts of its watershed are in Luzerne County."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Coles Creek is located in Pennsylvania. The relevant information indicates that Oregon abolished the death penalty in 1964 and later reinstated it in 1984. However, this does not pertain to Pennsylvania. There is no specific mention of Pennsylvania's reinstatement of the death penalty in the information provided. Therefore, I do not have the data necessary to directly answer the question for Pennsylvania.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The King's Speech is a 2010 British historical drama film directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.", 'The government, consisting of the monarch and the ministers, will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause, thereafter notifying the States General that "The King assents to the proposal." It has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament. In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill, notifying the States General that "The King will keep the proposal under advisement." A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King\'s Offices.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: In "The King's Speech," the monarch at the end of World War II is King George VI. Colin Firth plays the role of King George VI, the main character of the film. The film focuses on his struggles with a stammer and his relationship with Lionel Logue as he prepares for significant speeches during his reign. Given that the film is set around the time of his reign, it's clear that he is the monarch referred to in the question.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division and there have only been eight winners who weren't in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) - Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-league winners of the FA Cup. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.", "The 1914 FA Cup Final was a football match between Burnley and Liverpool on 25 April 1914 at Crystal Palace, London. It was the final match of the 1913–14 FA Cup, the 43rd season of the country's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, better known as the FA Cup. Both teams were appearing in their first final."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant fact to consider is that Notts County won the FA Cup in the 1894-95 season. I need to determine if Ken Faulkner's team, which is Birmingham City (the club he played for), has a historical record of defeating Notts County in any match. However, I do not have enough information on the specific matches that Ken Faulkner's team played against Notts County, nor the outcomes. Therefore, without this specific information about match results, I can't provide a definitive answer.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Bumping River is a tributary of the Naches River, in Washington in the United States. It flows down the east side of the Cascade Range, through Wenatchee National Forest and the William O. Douglas Wilderness. From its source at Fish Lake near Crag Mountain, it flows northeast to Bumping Lake, a natural lake enlarged and regulated by Bumping Lake Dam. Below the dam, the Bumping River continues flowing northeast. It is joined by the American River, its main tributary, a few miles above its mouth where it joins the Little Naches River to form the Naches River.', 'The Naches River is a tributary of the Yakima River in central Washington in the United States. Beginning as the Little Naches River, it is about 75 miles (121\xa0km) long. After the confluence of the Little Naches and Bumping River the name becomes simply the Naches River. The Naches and its tributaries drain a portion of the eastern side of the Cascade Range, east of Mount Rainier and northeast of Mount Adams. In terms of discharge, the Naches River is the largest tributary of the Yakima River.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Bumping River flows into the Little Naches River, which subsequently joins the Naches River. Therefore, the mouth of the Bumping River is the same as the mouth of the Little Naches River, which serves as the mouth of the Bumping River before it merges into the Naches River. 

Direct answer: Naches River

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Albert Bedouce (8 January 1869, Toulouse – 4 August 1947) was a French politician. He joined at first the French Workers' Party (POF), which in 1902 merged into the Socialist Party of France (PSdF), which in turn merged into the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905. Bedouce was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1906 to 1919 and from 1924 to 1940. He was Minister of Public Works from 1936 to 1937. In the 1939 presidential election Bedouce was the candidate of the SFIO, but lost to Albert Lebrun, the candidate of the Democratic Republican Alliance. On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. For this he was expelled from the SFIO after the Liberation of France. In 1945 he joined, with his associate Émile Berlia, the newly founded Democratic Socialist Party (PSD).", "Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs received 913,664 popular votes (3.4 percent), despite the fact that he was in prison at the time for advocating non-compliance with the draft during World War I. This was the largest number of popular votes ever received by a Socialist Party candidate in the United States, although not the largest percentage of the popular vote. Debs received double this percentage in the election of 1912. The 1920 election was Debs' fifth and last attempt to become president."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Albert Bedouce (8 January 1869, Toulouse – 4 August 1947) was a French politician. He joined at first the French Workers' Party (POF), which in 1902 merged into the Socialist Party of France (PSdF), which in turn merged into the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905. Bedouce was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1906 to 1919 and from 1924 to 1940. He was Minister of Public Works from 1936 to 1937. In the 1939 presidential election Bedouce was the candidate of the SFIO, but lost to Albert Lebrun, the candidate of the Democratic Republican Alliance. On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. For this he was expelled from the SFIO after the Liberation of France. In 1945 he joined, with his associate Émile Berlia, the newly founded Democratic Socialist Party (PSD).", "Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs received 913,664 popular votes (3.4 percent), despite the fact that he was in prison at the time for advocating non-compliance with the draft during World War I. This was the largest number of popular votes ever received by a Socialist Party candidate in the United States, although not the largest percentage of the popular vote. Debs received double this percentage in the election of 1912. The 1920 election was Debs' fifth and last attempt to become president."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: In 1912, the socialist candidate who ran for president was Eugene V. Debs. From the relevant facts in my memory, I know that Debs was affiliated with the Socialist Party of America. It is noted that he garnered significant support during the election, even though he was incarcerated at the time. Therefore, the political party he was part of for his presidential run in 1912 was indeed the Socialist Party of America.  
Direct answer: Socialist Party of America
TRUE ANSWER: Socialist Party of America

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Eighty - nine Major League Baseball All - Star Games have been played since the inaugural one in 1933. The American League (AL) leads the series with 44 victories; two games ended in ties. The National League (NL) has the longest winning streak of 11 games from 1972 -- 1982; the AL held a 13 - game unbeaten streak from 1997 -- 2009 (including a tie in 2002). The AL previously dominated from 1933 to 1949, winning 12 of the first 16. The NL dominated from 1950 to 1987, winning 33 of 42 with 1 tie, including a stretch from 1963 to 1982 when they won 19 of 20. Since 1988 the AL has dominated, winning 24 of 31 with one tie. In 2018 the AL took their first lead in the series since 1963.', 'The Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl nine times in franchise history, the most of any team, seven of them since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000. The Patriots have since become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, winning 14 AFC East titles in 16 seasons since 2001, without a losing season in that period. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten - year period (126, in 2003 -- 2012), an undefeated 16 - game regular season in 2007, the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21 - game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (won eight straight division titles from 2009 to 2016). The team owns the record for most Super Bowls reached (seven) and won (five) by a head coach -- quarterback tandem. The Patriots are tied with the 49ers and Cowboys for the second most Super Bowl wins with five. The Steelers are in front with six.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: To determine the longest win streak that includes the team with the most titles from the event preceding the awarding of the MLB MVP, we should consider the history of Major League Baseball. The team with the most World Series titles is the New York Yankees. Among the relevant facts, it is noted that the Cleveland Indians (now known as the Guardians) hold the record for the longest winning streak in MLB history with 22 games in the 2017 season. However, it does not appear that the New York Yankees are mentioned in connection with a significant win streak in this context. Therefore, based on the information provided and the context of the question, I will assess the longest available winning streak while keeping the Yankees' prominent title history in mind.

Direct answer: 22 games
TRUE ANSWER: 26

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Voice of ``Stan ''(Stephen Full) is the James - Jennings family's new dog who blogs and talks. He keeps his secret of talking from Ellen and Bennett, and the only people who know that Stan can talk are Avery, Tyler, Chloe, Karl, and Grandma James. Stan hates noisy pomeranians and has a deep love of poodles. It is shown that Avery is his favorite child which is also based on the fact they talk to each other the most of the three kids. As shown in`` World of Woofcraft'', he likes the game ``Realm of the Tower ''. Although at times he seems almost human, he is still a dog and has many dog qualities and is very sensitive about it. Stan, while he does not like to admit it, is also part cat and blames the fact that his dog ancestor`` married'' his one cat ancestor because it was the 1970s. Stan has a beloved toy monkey named Robert who is his companion. Grandma James found Robert while cleaning the family room and announced that the toy was so disgustingly filthy, it was going straight to the trash. Stan panicked and shouted Robert's name right in front of her, exposing his secret and making Grandma James faint. Stan is also very sensitive about being called ``just a dog '', which Avery called him in the episode`` Stan Runs Away''. After a year of secretly writing a blog about his experiences with the family, Avery, Chloe, and Tyler soon discover Stan's blog in ``The Kids Find Out Stan Blogs ''.", '"Not What He Seems" is the eleventh episode of the second season of the American animated television series "Gravity Falls", created by Alex Hirsch. The episode was written by Shion Takeuchi, Josh Weinstein, Jeff Rowe, Matt Chapman, and Hirsch, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. The series follows twelve-year-old twins Dipper (voiced by Jason Ritter) and Mabel Pines (voiced by Kristen Schaal), who stay for the summer with their great uncle Grunkle Stan (voiced by Hirsch) in a tourist trap called the Mystery Shack, set within the fictional town of Gravity Falls, Oregon.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.", 'Scanderbeg (; RV 732) is an opera ("dramma per musica") in three acts composed by Antonio Vivaldi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Salvi. It was first performed at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence on 22 June 1718 to mark the re-opening of the theatre to public performances. While the libretto has been preserved, only fragments of the original score remain.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator. In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General.The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands; Australian Antarctic Territory; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Coral Sea Islands; Heard Island and McDonald Islands; and Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales.", "Born in Woolhampton in Berkshire, his earliest known club was Reading, before he moved to Notts County, where he made 17 appearances in The Football League. He had a second spell with Reading and also played for West Ham United, where he was captain for the club's final season at the Memorial Grounds, before joining New Brompton in 1904, where he was a regular starter during the 1904–05 season. His later clubs included Grays Athletic and Clapton Orient, as well as two more spells with Reading."]

Both senators and representatives are elected from their constituents' districts.", 'The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes. No Democratic - held seats had fallen to the Republican Party in the 2006 elections. Democrat Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House. The House also received the first Muslim (Keith Ellison) and Buddhist (Hank Johnson and Mazie Hirono) members of Congress.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The majority party in the House of Representatives has the ability to determine the rules of its proceedings. The information suggests that the Republicans gained control of the House following the 2014 elections, which allowed them to dictate the rules. Additionally, it notes that the Republicans maintained control in the elections of November 2016 and had control of both houses of Congress. Directly, the majority party in the House would have taken control of these rules starting from when they gained the majority in the House, which was in the 114th Congress (2015-2016) and continued into the 115th Congress (2017-2018).

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["André S. Dreiding (22 June 1919 in Zürich – 24 December 2013 in Herrliberg near Zurich) was a Swiss chemist. He finished his high school studies in Zürich and then studied at Columbia University in New York where he was awarded BS and MS degrees. After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952. In 1954, Dreiding turned to Switzerland and University of Zurich, where he became professor, and stayed until his retirement in 1987, after which he has been emeritus professor.", 'There are 12 universities in Switzerland, ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. The biggest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students. The two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the ETHZ in Zürich (founded 1855) and the EPFL in Lausanne (founded 1969 as such, formerly an institute associated with the University of Lausanne) which both have an excellent international reputation.[note 10]']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["There are 67 counties in the state of Florida. It became a territory of the U.S. in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory: Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east, divided by the Suwannee River. All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County. Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters. All but two of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities. The exceptions are Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County, and East Naples, located outside Naples city limits in Collier County.", 'Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. It is the county seat of Duval County, with which the city government consolidated in 1968. Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits; with an estimated population of 853,382 in 2014, it is the most populous city proper in Florida and the Southeast, and the 12th most populous in the United States.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.', "In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the Americans. Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned that the Americans would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. At that time, the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5.6 million soldiers. However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border. Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: In the context provided, Mao Zedong is identified as the individual who argued that the Soviet Union, which was the country of citizenship for Yuri Kleschev, had itself become an imperialist power. He also declared his intent to intervene in the Korean conflict by agreeing to support the North Korean invasion after meeting with Kim Il-sung. Therefore, the answer corresponds to where Mao made this declaration regarding the Korean conflict.
Direct answer: Mao Zedong declared that he would intervene in the Korean conflict.
TRUE ANSWER: the Politburo

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 action spy film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum.  The screenplay was written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and based on a screen story of the novel by Gilroy.  The Bourne Ultimatum is the third in the Jason Bourne film series, being preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016.', "Jason Morgan is a fictional character on the ABC soap opera, General Hospital. Created by Thom Racina and Leah Laiman, he is most notably played by Daytime Emmy Award - winning actor Steve Burton, who joined the cast in 1991 and vacated the role in 2012. Jason was born offscreen in September 1981 and the character made his onscreen debut in November 1981 as the son of Dr. Alan Quartermaine (Stuart Damon) and his mistress, Susan Moore (Gail Ramsey), later adopted by Alan's wife Dr. Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson). As one of the longest - running characters on the show, the role was played by various child actors from 1982 to 1986. In 2014, actor Billy Miller was cast in the role."]

It used a Betamax cassette and rested on the operator's shoulder, due to a design not permitting a single - handed grip. That year, JVC released the first VHS - C camcorder. Kodak announced a new camcorder format in 1984, the 8 mm video format. Sony introduced its compact 8 mm Video8 format in 1985. That year, Panasonic, RCA and Hitachi began producing camcorders using a full - size VHS cassette with a three - hour capacity. These shoulder - mount camcorders were used by videophiles, industrial videographers and college TV studios. Full - size Super-VHS (S - VHS) camcorders were released in 1987, providing an inexpensive way to collect news segments or other videographies. Sony upgraded Video8, releasing the Hi8 in competition with S - VHS.", 'Belarus chose Dmitry Koldun with the song "Work Your Magic" to represent the nation at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. Using the Eurofest 2007 format on 15 December 2006, televoting narrowed down fifteen performers to Dmitry Koldun, selected by televoting, and Diana Gurtskaya and The Project, selected by the professional jury. The three competitors entered the superfinal where they could change their song if they wished. On 22 January 2007, the three performed their song in front of a strict government jury, which decided that Dmitry Koldun was the most suitable performer to represent Belarus. The song was written by Karen Kavaleryan and composed by Philip Kirkorov.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Partition of India was the division of British India in 1947 which accompanied the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan. The Dominion of India is today the Republic of India, and the Dominion of Pakistan is today the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and the Punjab, based on district-wise Hindu or Muslim majorities. The boundary demarcating India and Pakistan became known as the Radcliffe Line. It also involved the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury, between the two new dominions. The partition was set forth in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, as the British government there was called. The two self - governing countries of Pakistan and India legally came into existence at midnight on 14 -- 15 August 1947.", "The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduvān (Hindus) and hindavī was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The majority religion in British India that became India is Hinduism. The Arabic equivalent of the term "India" is "Al-Hind." Therefore, the relevant dictionary meaning of the term referring to the majority religion (Hinduism) does not directly translate to Arabic as it does for India itself. However, "Hindu" in Arabic is usually referred to as "هندو" (Hindu), but its dictionary meaning concerning religion would align with being associated with the practices and beliefs of the religion that is predominantly Hindu in the region of India. Since the specific Arabic dictionary meaning of "Hindu" is not provided in the data, it is unclear.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The US ended World War I with two 3-inch AA guns and improvements were developed throughout the inter-war period. However, in 1924 work started on a new 105 mm static mounting AA gun, but only a few were produced by the mid-1930s because by this time work had started on the 90 mm AA gun, with mobile carriages and static mountings able to engage air, sea and ground targets. The M1 version was approved in 1940. During the 1920s there was some work on a 4.7-inch which lapsed, but revived in 1937, leading to a new gun in 1944.', "John Krasinski as Jack Ryan, an analyst working for the Central Intelligence Agency. Krasinski's interpretation of the character is said to be inspired by Ford's portrayal in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Director and executive producer Daniel Sackheim said: ``What was so great about the Harrison Ford movies was that they were about an everyman hero. He was a guy who was n't a superhero. He was heroic, but he was vulnerable. He was n't afraid to be scared. He was a regular man and a hero. ''"]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Wayne Gretzky won the award a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. He has been named MVP more times than any other player in the history of the other three North American major professional leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association, and National Football League). Barry Bonds is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.', 'MLB Tonight is the signature program that airs on MLB Network and is simulcast on MLB Network Radio. The show offers complete coverage of all Major League Baseball games from 6pm ET till 1am ET during the regular season, and gives news from all 30 MLB teams during the offseason. It is taped live in Studio 3 of the MLB Network facility in Secaucus, New Jersey, but also features segments taped in Studio 42. The program aired from the beginning of Spring Training to the end of the World Series and was replaced in the offseason by "Hot Stove", until it started to air in the offseason, and "Hot Stove" became MLB Network\'s weekday morning show. The show won the Sports Emmy Award for best Daily Outstanding Studio Show for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The team that won the AL East in 2017 was the Boston Red Sox. The MVP award in MLB is awarded based on the regular season performance, and the voting outcomes are typically announced after the postseason concludes. The last event after which the MLB MVP is awarded is the World Series. The last World Series as of 2017 occurred from October 24 to November 1, 2017. Since the Red Sox did not play in the postseason due to having been eliminated before the World Series, they last played in the regular season before the postseason started, which was prior to the end of the World Series. However, they would not have played in the postseason leading up to the MVP announcement.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Battle for Mexico City was the series of engagements from September 8 to September 15, 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the Mexican–American War. Included are major actions at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec, culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the Battle of Churubusco on August 8 where the Saint Patrick's Battalion, which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants, but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexican people, fought for the Mexican cause repelling the American attacks. After defeating the Saint Patrick's Battalion, the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States deployed combat units deep into Mexico resulting in the capture of Mexico City and Veracruz by the U.S. Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions. The invasion culminated with the storming of Chapultepec Castle in the city itself.", 'Starting in 1910, the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft. In 1910, Mexico was having a civil war, peasant rebels fighting government soldiers. The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property. In 1916, Pancho Villa, a major rebel leader, attacked Columbus, New Mexico, prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917. They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918. The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and other allies. U.S. troops were sent to the Western Front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war. With the armistice in November 1918, the army once again decreased its forces.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Jefferson Davis is the author of The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government. He fought in the Mexican-American War, which ended with the capture of Mexico City and the conclusion of major hostilities in September 1847. Therefore, the end of his fight in the Mexican-American War would coincide with the close of the war.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In 2004, Bank of America announced it would purchase Boston - based bank FleetBoston Financial for $47 billion in cash and stock. By merging with Bank of America, all of its banks and branches were given the Bank of America logo. At the time of merger, FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with $197 billion in assets, over 20 million customers and revenue of $12 billion. Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to The Boston Globe.', "Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important regional institutions, including the acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati–based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities. Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: FleetBoston Financial was acquired by Bank of America. I recall that Bank of America operates in all 50 states and is a major player in investment banking. However, I need to determine the number of ATMs that Bank of America has, as that information is not directly provided in the facts. The only direct mention of ATMs is related to RBL Bank, which has 387 ATMs, and Union Bank of India, which has 7,642 ATMs. There is no specific number mentioned for Bank of America. Therefore, based on the available information, I have doubts about the exact number of ATMs at Bank of America.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle\'s Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter\'s Astronomy (1727) was advertised as "a Work entirely New" that would include "short and easie  [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables." The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet\'s translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton\'s theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti, writing for a growing female audience, published Il Newtonianism per le dame, which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Pembarton. His A View of Sir Isaac Newton\'s Philosophy was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class. During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. Sarah Trimmer wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.', 'Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States, by Min Zhou and Carl L. Bankston III is one of the most influential books on the Vietnamese American experience. Published in 1998 by the Russell Sage Foundation, it is widely used in college classes on international migration, contemporary American history, and Asian Studies. The book emphasizes the role of Vietnamese communities in promoting the adaptation of Vietnamese American young people.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The man who produced "The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch" is not directly named in the relevant facts, but the book "Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States" is authored by Min Zhou and Carl L. Bankston III, discussing the Vietnamese American experience. Since we are trying to find a book about growing up in the same nationality, and there is a reference to Vietnamese American identity, I can conclude that Min Zhou and Carl L. Bankston III are the authors I need. However, I need to confirm the nationality of the producer for accurate naming. Since I am not provided with that specific producer's nationality, my answer remains focused on the authors mentioned in relation to the Vietnamese context.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Ioannina National Airport is named in honor of King Pyrrhus. To determine the years of the war associated with him, I need to consider his historical context. King Pyrrhus of Epirus is known for his conflicts against the Roman Republic, particularly during the Pyrrhic War, which took place between 280 BCE and 275 BCE. Therefore, the war years can be directly derived from this historical period.

Direct answer: 280 BCE to 275 BCE

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a "German" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the Saxons, Franci, Thuringii, Alamanni and Bavarii. These five tribes, sometimes with inclusion of the Frisians, are considered as the major groups to take part in the formation of the Germans. The varieties of the German language are still divided up into these groups. Linguists distinguish low Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian, Thuringian and Alemannic varieties in modern German. By the 9th century, the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern Germany had been united under the rule of the Frankish king Charlemagne, known in German as Karl der Große. Much of what is now Eastern Germany became Slavonic-speaking (Sorbs and Veleti), after these areas were vacated by Germanic tribes (Vandals, Lombards, Burgundians and Suebi amongst others) which had migrated into the former areas of the Roman Empire.', "The first permanent European settlements in Canada were at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608 as fur trading posts. The territories of New France were Canada, Acadia (later renamed Nova Scotia), and Louisiana. The inhabitants of Canada called themselves the Canadiens, and came mostly from northwestern France. The early inhabitants of Acadia, or Acadiens, came mostly but not exclusively from the Southwestern region of France. Canadien explorers and fur traders would come to be known as coureurs des bois, while those who settled on farms in Canada would come to be known as habitants. Many French Canadians are the descendants of the King's Daughters of this era. Many also are the descendants of mixed French and Algonquin marriages."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The last name Sylvester originates from the Latin adjective "silvestris." In the 9th century, the king who united the tribes was Charlemagne, who ruled over what is now modern Germany. The language that would have been in use during his reign, particularly in a scholarly context, would have changed from classical Latin and transitioned into medieval Latin. Therefore, the version of the language referred to in the question is medieval Latin.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps.', 'Traditionally, major college basketball teams began their seasons with a few exhibition games. They played travelling teams made up of former college players on teams such as Athletes in Action or a team sponsored by Marathon Oil. On occasion before 1992, when FIBA allowed professional players on foreign national teams, colleges played those teams in exhibitions. However, in 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association banned games with non-college teams. Some teams have begun scheduling exhibition games against teams in NCAA Division II and NCAA Division III, or even against colleges and universities located in Canada. Major college basketball teams still travel to other countries during the summer to play in exhibition games, although a college team is allowed one foreign tour every four years, and a maximum of ten games in each tour.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The site where Jimmy Carter was nominated for president is Madison Square Garden, which is located in New York City. The teams that host NBA games at this venue would include the New York Knicks and the New York Liberty. The New Jersey Devils, which is a team in the NHL and does not play NBA games, also has a location but they host games at the Prudential Center in Newark. Therefore, the New Jersey Devils do not host NBA games at Madison Square Garden.

An anime television series adaptation directed by Noriyuki Abe started airing on TV Tokyo on April 5, 2017.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['BULLET::::- Cosmic Boy, along with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, made his live-action debut in the eleventh episode of the eighth season of the CW series "Smallville", portrayed by actor Ryan Kennedy. In the episode, Rokk is seen as the silent leader type. The most determined of the group, Rokk comes the closest to killing Chloe Sullivan, only to be stopped by Clark Kent, who informs Rokk that any Legion inspired by him should never resort to murder. When the group does defeat Brainiac by extracting him from Chloe - Rokk playing a crucial role as he magnetically extracts the particles of Brainiac from her body - Rokk changes the Legion rules accordingly. Just before he leaves, Rokk warns Clark of the days ahead, telling him to be careful. Though mainly referred to as Rokk, Lightning Lad calls him "Cos" at one point in the episode. He later returns in the season finale to give Clark a new Legion ring after his was destroyed in "Infamous" and warns him that nothing can stop Doomsday from killing him. He gives Clark the ring and tells him to send Doomsday to the future, as the Legion is prepared to fight him there.', 'Smallville is an American television series developed by writer-producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school. After season five "Smallville" ventures into adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the "Daily Planet" and introducing other DC comic-book superheroes and villains.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The work that features the appearance of Cosmic Boy is the television series "Smallville." This series was developed by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, based on the DC Comics character Superman, who was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. However, Cosmic Boy is a character from DC Comics, which links back to the original creators of Superman rather than the show itself. Thus, Gough and Millar are the creators of "Smallville," where Cosmic Boy appears.  
Direct answer: Alfred Gough and Miles Millar

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Palau Güell (, ) is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaudí for the industrial tycoon Eusebi Güell and built between 1886 and 1888. It is situated on the Carrer Nou de la Rambla, in the El Raval neighbourhood of the city of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Works of Antoni Gaudí".', 'The Museu d\'Art Jaume Morera (Jaume Morera Art Museum) is a museum in Lleida (Catalonia) created by the Diputació de Lleida and the Lleida City Council ("La Paeria") with the collaboration of the painter Jaume Morera i Galícia. It is the museum of modern and contemporary art of the city of Lleida. Today is municipally owned and receives financial support from the "Diputació de Lleida" and the Department of Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia. Its entrance is free.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Palau de la Generalitat is mentioned in relation to the kings of Aragon, and considering Isuerre is located in the province of Zaragoza, it implies a connection to Aragon. However, I cannot find specific information on when the Palau de la Generalitat was constructed. Therefore, I conclude that I don't have enough data to provide a concrete construction date regarding the stated context about Martin and Isuerre. 
Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: built in the 15th century

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Following the 2000 census, the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional district. For the 112th Congress (2011–2013), there were no changes in party strength, and the delegation included four Republicans and one Democrat. In the 112th Congress, Oklahoma's U.S. senators were Republicans Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn, and its U.S. Representatives were John Sullivan (R-OK-1), Dan Boren (D-OK-2), Frank D. Lucas (R-OK-3), Tom Cole (R-OK-4), and James Lankford (R-OK-5).", 'The Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States as President of the United States Senate. The Constitution also calls for a President pro tempore to serve as the leader of the body when the President of the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President pro tempore -- customarily the most senior (longest - serving) Senator in the majority party -- actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior Senators of the majority party. Since the Vice President may be of a different party than the majority and is not a member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role. For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate. This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The party of Oklahoma's U.S. Senators, both of whom were Republicans following the last notable election, gained control of the majority in the Senate. Considering the relevant information, it can be inferred that the Republican Party regained majority control of the Senate in January 2007 after gaining seats in previous elections. This indicated that they had control over the Senate, which ultimately is responsible for determining its rules and procedures. Therefore, in reference to "the body determining the rules of the US House and US Senate," it can be concluded that when Republicans first took control over the Senate aligns with their significant regain noted in 2007.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Supreme Court is the highest court in Ireland. It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional. It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law. Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law. The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government. The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.', "Laura Denvir Stith (born October 30, 1953) has been a judge on the Supreme Court of Missouri since 2001.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Poland's nobility were also more numerous than those of all other European countries, constituting some 10–12% of the total population of historic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth also some 10–12% among ethnic Poles on ethnic Polish lands (part of Commonwealth), but up to 25% of all Poles worldwide (szlachta could dispose more of resources to travels and/or conquering), while in some poorer regions (e.g., Mazowsze, the area centred on Warsaw) nearly 30%. However, according to  szlachta comprised around 8% of the total population in 1791 (up from 6.6% in the 16th century), and no more than 16% of the Roman Catholic (mostly ethnically Polish) population. It should be noted, though, that Polish szlachta usually incorporated most local nobility from the areas that were absorbed by Poland–Lithuania (Ruthenian boyars, Livonian nobles, etc.) By contrast, the nobilities of other European countries, except for Spain, amounted to a mere 1–3%, however the era of sovereign rules of Polish nobility ended earlier than in other countries (excluding France) yet in 1795 (see: Partitions of Poland), since then their legitimation and future fate depended on legislature and procedures of Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia or Habsburg Monarchy. Gradually their privileges were under further limitations to be completely dissolved by March Constitution of Poland in 1921.", 'Federalism has a long tradition in German history. The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796. The number of territories was greatly reduced during the Napoleonic Wars (1796–1814). After the Congress of Vienna (1815), 39 states formed the German Confederation. The Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian War and replaced by a North German Federation under Prussian hegemony; this war left Prussia dominant in Germany, and German nationalism would compel the remaining independent states to ally with Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, and then to accede to the crowning of King Wilhelm of Prussia as German Emperor. The new German Empire included 25 states (three of them, Hanseatic cities) and the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The empire was dominated by Prussia, which controlled 65% of the territory and 62% of the population. After the territorial losses of the Treaty of Versailles, the remaining states continued as republics of a new German federation. These states were gradually de facto abolished and reduced to provinces under the Nazi regime via the Gleichschaltung process, as the states administratively were largely superseded by the Nazi Gau system.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The privileges held by the Polish nobility (szlachta) were gradually limited and ultimately dissolved by the March Constitution of Poland in 1921. The empire that utilized Pan-Slavism as a political tool was the Russian Empire, which had an impact on the Polish nobility's legitimization and privileges. The leader of the North German Confederation during the Franco-Prussian War was Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy also had a significant influence on the region. Ultimately, these empires had varying roles in the governance and administration of Polish nobility's rights, which were formally resolved in 1921. 
Direct answer: March Constitution of Poland in 1921.
TRUE ANSWER: March Constitution of Poland

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In South Africa, pass laws were a form of internal passport system designed to segregate the population, manage urbanisation, and allocate migrant labour. Also known as the natives law, pass laws severely limited the movements of not only black African citizens, but other people's as well by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950s, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. Pass laws would be one of the dominant features of the country's apartheid system, until it was effectively ended in 1986.", 'Cyberdyne Systems Series T-800 / T-850 Model 101, or "The Terminator", is a fictional character from the "Terminator" franchise portrayed by both Arnold Schwarzenegger and numerous actor stand-ins digitally overlaid with Schwarzenegger\'s likeness. The Terminator itself is part of a series of machines created by Skynet for infiltration-based assassination missions, and while an android for its appearance resembling a human, it is described as a cybernetic organism consisting of living tissue over a robotic endoskeleton.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid's first team in response to an appeal made by then - Real Madrid coach José Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach. In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid's new sporting director. In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.", 'North Carolina is home to three major league sports franchises: the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League and the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association are based in Charlotte, while the Raleigh-based Carolina Hurricanes play in the National Hockey League. The Panthers and Hurricanes are the only two major professional sports teams that have the same geographical designation while playing in different metropolitan areas. The Hurricanes are the only major professional team from North Carolina to have won a league championship, having captured the Stanley Cup in 2006. North Carolina is also home to Charlotte Hounds of the Major League Lacrosse.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Partition of India was the division of British India in 1947 which accompanied the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan. The Dominion of India is today the Republic of India, and the Dominion of Pakistan is today the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of three provinces, Assam, Bengal and the Punjab, based on district - wide Hindu or Muslim majorities. The boundary demarcating India and Pakistan became known as the Radcliffe Line. It also involved the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury, between the two new dominions. The partition was set forth in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, as the British government there was called.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire declared independence from foreign powers, particularly the Portuguese, which suggests a historical context involving foreign influence and colonization. The question seems to imply a connection to the expulsion of people connected to this struggle. Since the natural boundary mentioned is between Thailand and Laos, where Nam Theun is located, I consider the colonial and geopolitical dynamics relevant in both the Somali context (with reference to Ottoman interactions) and the Southeast Asian context. However, without specific historical events tying the Ajuran Empire's independence directly to the expulsion of a certain group from the Thai-Laos boundary region, it remains unclear. 

Direct answer: Unknown

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: There is information indicating that the presidential term is set at six years in the United States since 1934, and that the president is elected by direct suffrage. However, the question specifically concerns the term for the prime minister in a country where legislators are elected for six-year terms, but the details of such a country's prime ministerial title or designation were not mentioned directly in the provided facts. Therefore, I do not have sufficient information to provide a specific term used for the prime minister in this context.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['When World War II started in 1939, it divided the world into two alliances—the Allies (the United Kingdom and France at first in Europe, China in Asia since 1937, followed in 1941 by the Soviet Union, the United States); and the Axis powers consisting of Germany, Italy and Japan.[nb 1] During World War II, the United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union controlled Allied policy and emerged as the "Big Three". The Republic of China and the Big Three were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful"  and were recognized as the Allied "Big Four" in Declaration by United Nations in 1942. These four countries were referred as the "Four Policemen" of the Allies and considered as the primary victors of World War II. The importance of France was acknowledged by their inclusion, along with the other four, in the group of countries allotted permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.', "Following Mark's eviction, the HouseGuests were splattered in the Everyone's A Wiener Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must brace themselves with handholds and footholds inside their hot dog bun. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Jason was the winner. For being the first two people to drop in the Head of Household competition, Kevin and Matt became Have - Nots for the week. On Day 66, the Tree of Temptation turned red. However, nobody accepted the temptation. On Day 66, Jason nominated Matt and Raven, with Matt as the target. On Day 67, Jason, Matt, Raven, Josh, Paul, and Kevin went on the lookout in the Hide and Go Veto Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had three minutes to individually hide their locked veto card in the House. Then, one at a time, HouseGuests entered the House and had one minute to attempt to find a veto card. If a HouseGuest's veto card is found, they will be eliminated, though the owner of the veto cards will not be revealed until the end of the competition. The HouseGuest who hides their veto card the best will win the Power of Veto. Jason was the winner. On Day 69, Jason decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 71, Matt broke the Have - Not rules and earned a penalty vote on eviction night. On Day 72, Matt was evicted by a 6 - 0 vote. He became the fourth member of the jury."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['During the Middle Ages, the Eritrea region was known as Medri Bahri ("sea-land"). The name Eritrea is derived from the ancient Greek name for Red Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa, based on the adjective ἐρυθρός erythros "red"). It was first formally adopted in 1890, with the formation of Italian Eritrea (Colonia Eritrea). The territory became the Eritrea Governorate within Italian East Africa in 1936. Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia in 1953 (nominally within a federation until 1962) and an Eritrean Liberation Front formed in 1960. Eritrea gained independence following the 1993 referendum, and the name of the new state was defined as State of Eritrea in the 1997 constitution.[citation needed]', "According to recent estimates, 50% of the population adheres to Christianity, Islam 48%, while 2% of the population follows other religions including traditional African religion and animism. According to a study made by Pew Research Center, 63% adheres to Christianity and 36% adheres to Islam. Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Oriental Orthodox), Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church (a Metropolitanate sui juris) and the Evangelical Lutheran church. All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process. Among other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership to be allowed to worship."]

In Eritrea, approximately 50% of the population adheres to Christianity according to the information available. Therefore, the percentage of Eritrea adhering to the religion widely practiced in the region with the 2nd largest rainforest is 50%.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Detroit (/dᵻˈtrɔɪt/) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United States–Canada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. Detroit's metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 5.3 million people, making it the fourteenth-most populous metropolitan area in the United States and the second-largest in the Midwestern United States (behind Chicago). It is a major port on the Detroit River, a strait that connects the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest economic region in the Midwest, behind Chicago, and the thirteenth-largest in the United States.", 'The Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of three counties: Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester. As of the 2013 U.S. Census, the metropolitan statistical area had a total population of 712,239 people. North Charleston is the second-largest city in the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville Metropolitan Statistical Area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state; Mount Pleasant and Summerville are the next-largest cities. These cities combined with other incorporated and unincorporated areas along with the city of Charleston form the Charleston-North Charleston Urban Area with a population of 548,404 as of 2010. The metropolitan statistical area also includes a separate and much smaller urban area within Berkeley County, Moncks Corner (with a 2000 population of 9,123).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Oh Yeah performer, Charles Mingus, was born in Nogales, Arizona. The second-largest city in Arizona is Tucson. In 1900, Tucson had a population that can be looked up but is not directly provided in my memory or relevant texts. Since I do not have the information about Tucson's population in 1900, I conclude that I cannot provide a concrete answer.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.", "The final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division and there have only been eight winners who weren't in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) - Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-league winners of the FA Cup. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The 1894-95 FA Cup winner was Notts County. I need to find information regarding Darren Carter's team and when they last faced Notts County. However, the information available does not specify any particular match records or last encounters involving Carter and Notts County. As such, I cannot conclusively determine when his team last beat them.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858, when, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria (who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India). It lasted until 1947, when Britain ′ s Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states: the Dominion of India (later the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern part of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh). At the inception of the Raj in 1858, Lower Burma was already a part of British India; Upper Burma was added in 1886, and the resulting union, Burma, was administered as an autonomous province until 1937, when it became a separate British colony, gaining its own independence in 1948.", 'The empire went into decline thereafter. The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas and Afghans. During the decline of the Mughal Empire, several smaller states rose to fill the power vacuum and themselves were contributing factors to the decline. In 1737, the Maratha general Bajirao of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao, however, easily routed the novice Mughal general and the rest of the imperial Mughal army fled. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire. In 1739, Nader Shah, emperor of Iran, defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal. After this victory, Nader captured and sacked Delhi, carrying away many treasures, including the Peacock Throne. The Mughal dynasty was reduced to puppet rulers by 1757. The remnants of the Mughal dynasty were finally defeated during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also called the 1857 War of Independence, and the remains of the empire were formally taken over by the British while the Government of India Act 1858 let the British Crown assume direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The ruler that was dissolved after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 refers to the British East India Company. This company was established in 1600 when it was chartered by Queen Elizabeth I. The relevant facts indicate that the governance of India was transferred from this company to the British Crown in 1858 following the rebellion.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 2004, Oldman returned to prominence when he landed a significant role in the Harry Potter film series, playing Harry Potter's godfather Sirius Black. The following year, he starred as James Gordon in Christopher Nolan's commercially and critically successful Batman Begins, a role that he reprised in the even more successful sequel The Dark Knight (2008) and once more in the conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing The Dark Knight, downplayed claims that Heath Ledger's Joker was the highlight of the film, saying, ``the best performance in the film, by a mile, is Gary Oldman's... it would be lovely to see him get a (n Academy Award) nomination because actually, he's the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this. ''Oldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer's supernatural thriller The Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli. He also played a lead role in Catherine Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood. Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in Kung Fu Panda 2.", "Having grown up in a laboratory, Damian Wayne as a pre-adolescent is left by his mother in the care of his father, who had been unaware of his son's existence. He is violent and self - important and was trained by the League of Assassins, learning to kill at a young age, which troubles the relationship with his father, who refuses to kill. However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny. After the events of Batman R.I.P. and Batman: Battle for the Cowl, he takes the role of Robin at ten years of age, becoming the fifth person to use the Robin persona. He first worked with Dick Grayson before going to work alongside his father, upon the original's return to the role of Batman. He continued to serve as Robin until 2013's Batman, Inc. # 8, in which he is killed by the Heretic, an agent of his mother and his own artificially - aged clone. In 2014's Batman and Robin vol. 2, # 37, Batman resurrects Damian Wayne."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Neil Patrick Harris plays the character of Barney Stinson in "How I Met Your Mother." However, he is not associated with "Batman: Under the Red Hood." Jensen Ackles voices the character of Red Hood / Jason Todd in that animated film. Therefore, Neil Patrick Harris does not play a character in "Batman: Under the Red Hood."

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: In 2002, the controlling party of the House of Representatives was the Republican Party, led by Speaker Dennis Hastert. The leader of the opposition party, which was the Democratic Party, was Nancy Pelosi who served as the Minority Leader.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In the early 1680s, King Charles II of England began taking steps to reorganize the colonies of New England.  The charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was revoked in 1684 after its leaders refused to act on his demands for reforms in the colony, when Charles sought to streamline the administration of the colonies and bring them more closely under crown control. He died in 1685 but his successor continued the efforts, Roman Catholic James II, culminating in his creation of the Dominion of New England. He appointed former New York governor Sir Edmund Andros as dominion governor in 1686. The dominion was composed of the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony, Connecticut Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In 1688, its jurisdiction was expanded to include New York, East Jersey, and West Jersey.Andros's rule was extremely unpopular in New England. He disregarded local representation, denied the validity of existing land titles in Massachusetts (which had been dependent on the old charter), restricted town meetings, and forced the Church of England into largely Puritan regions.  He also enforced the Navigation Acts which threatened the existence of certain trading practices of New England. The royal troops stationed in Boston were often mistreated by their officers, who were supporters of the governor and often either Anglican or Roman Catholic.", "Oklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 2010, including four cities over 100,000 in population and 43 over 10,000. Two of the fifty largest cities in the United States are located in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and 65 percent of Oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas, or spheres of economic and social influence defined by the United States Census Bureau as a metropolitan statistical area. Oklahoma City, the state's capital and largest city, had the largest metropolitan area in the state in 2010, with 1,252,987 people, and the metropolitan area of Tulsa had 937,478 residents. Between 2000 and 2010, the cities that led the state in population growth were Blanchard (172.4%), Elgin (78.2%), Jenks (77.0%), Piedmont (56.7%), Bixby (56.6%), and Owasso (56.3%)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The region of the U.S. where trading practices were once threatened by the Navigation Acts refers to New England. The largest state in New England is Massachusetts. However, the question asks for the population of the largest state in the region, and I need to confirm the population of Massachusetts. According to my knowledge, Massachusetts has a population over 6 million based on recent estimates and census data. Thus, considering this information, I can confidently state the population. 
Direct answer: Approximately 6.9 million

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software. The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free of charge." The earliest-known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition of the now-discontinued GNU\'s Bulletin publication of FSF. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. , it is published there in 39 languages. FSF publishes a list of licences which meet this definition.', 'In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix. The name GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU\'s Not Unix". Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts. Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Free Software Directory is a project of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The FSF was founded by Richard Stallman, who also published the Free Software Definition. Since the directory is developed by the FSF, it follows that Stallman, as its founder, started the organization that developed the Free Software Directory.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['According to Chen, the Ming officer of Hezhou (modern day Linxia) informed the Hongwu Emperor that the general situation in Dbus and Gtsang "was under control," and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second Phagmodru ruler, Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen, an official title. According to the Records of the Founding Emperor, the Hongwu Emperor issued an edict granting the title "Initiation State Master" to Sagya Gyaincain, while the latter sent envoys to the Ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira.', 'In his usurpation of the throne from the Jianwen Emperor (r. 1398–1402), the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao, and like his father, the Hongwu Emperor, the Yongle Emperor was "well-disposed towards Buddhism", claims Rossabi. On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor. A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa. The letter of invitation reads,']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Yongle Emperor greeted the leader known as Deshin Shekpa, the 5th Karmapa Lama, in Nanjing. Since the question is asking for an opera company based in that city, I can refer to the information provided. The relevant facts indicate that Nanjing hosts various art groups, but they do not specify an opera company. In my data, there is no specific mention of an opera company in Nanjing, which creates uncertainty. Therefore, I will state "Unknown" due to insufficient information regarding a specific opera company in Nanjing.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months -- a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March / early April to late September / early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 261⁄2 weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day. It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games in the League Championship Series / World Series).', 'Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization, the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams play in the National League (NL) and American League (AL), with 15 teams in each league. The NL and AL operated as separate legal entities from 1876 and 1901 respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities since 1903, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball in 2000. The organization also oversees Minor League Baseball, which comprises about 240 teams affiliated with the Major League clubs. With the World Baseball Softball Confederation, MLB manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The MLB MVP award is given out after the World Series, and the team with the most World Series titles is the New York Yankees with 27 titles. The MLB season typically begins around late March/early April, with the official Opening Day occurring on a Monday or the first day of April when possible. As the season runs up to late September/early October, the information suggests that Opening Day falls in early April. Therefore, I can conclude that Opening Day for the league associated with the team with the most World Series titles will be around that time.

Direct answer: April 1
TRUE ANSWER: Thursday, March 29

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.', 'A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.']

The information regarding the RX 350 indicates that a facelift was designed and unveiled in 2012, with new features and body style changes. Therefore, the body style of the RX 350 was changed in 2012.  
Direct answer: 2012
TRUE ANSWER: Sales began worldwide in April 2012

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was released from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoulême, left England for Angoulême soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons – Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip – and three daughters – Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.", "Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the son of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte. Fifth in line is Prince Henry of Wales, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Sixth in line is Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the Queen's second - eldest son. Any of the first six in line marrying without the sovereign's consent would be disqualified from succession."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: John's eldest son is Henry III. The information indicates that he ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century, but it does not specify the exact date when he was crowned. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific date of his coronation.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['True Grit is a 2010 American Revisionist Western film directed, written, produced, and edited by the Coen brothers and executively produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously released in 1969 starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell. This version stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Deputy U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.', 'Charles J. Richman (January 12, 1865 – December 1, 1940) was an American stage and film actor who appeared in 66 films between 1914 and 1939. Long before entering films Richman, in his youth one of the handsomest men on the stage, achieved a tremendous amount of stardom and success in the legitimate theatre. Most certainly film acting was an afterthought in his long and distinguished stage career. In Hollywood, he often played supporting roles as a dignified authoritarian figures like General Tufto in the first Technicolor film "Becky Sharp" (1935) and Judge Thatcher in "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" (1938).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: "Adventure's End" stars John Wayne, who is recognized for his iconic roles in Western films. In the 1969 adaptation of "True Grit," John Wayne played the character Rooster Cogburn. However, the mention of "Adventure's End" refers to a film where John Wayne starred, which means he is the actor in question. Therefore, I am explicitly tying the actor to his role in "True Grit." 
Direct answer: Rooster Cogburn
TRUE ANSWER: U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator. In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General.The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands; Australian Antarctic Territory; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Coral Sea Islands; Heard Island and McDonald Islands; and Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales.", 'From 1991 to 2005, the Braves were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times (omitting the strike - shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions), and producing the greatest pitching rotation in the history of baseball. The Braves won the NL West 1991 -- 93 and the NL East 1995 -- 2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010. The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 17 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships -- in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The university that features Fort Hill is Clemson University, which has won 5 national championships. Edwards won the primary in multiple states, including Georgia. The Richmond Braves moved to Georgia. Therefore, I need to find the university in Georgia and its national championships. Georgia's major university is the University of Georgia, which has won 2 national championships. Comparing the two, Clemson University has won more national championships than the University of Georgia. 

Direct answer: Clemson University

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['William Beckford (baptised 19 December 1709 – 21 June 1770) was a well-known political figure in 18th-century London, who twice held the office of Lord Mayor of London (1762 and 1769). His vast wealth came largely from his plantations in Jamaica and the large numbers of slaves working on these plantations. He was, and is, often referred to as "Alderman Beckford" to distinguish him from his son William Thomas Beckford, the author and art collector.', "Beckford's Tower, originally known as Lansdown Tower, is an architectural folly built in neo-classical style on Lansdown Hill, just outside Bath, Somerset, England. The tower and its attached railings are designated as a Grade I listed building. Along with the adjoining Lansdown Cemetery it is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Since its construction in 1884, the property and mansion were claimed by many to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed with Winchester rifles. Under Winchester's day - to - day guidance, its ``from - the - ground - up ''construction proceeded around the clock, by some accounts, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased. Sarah Winchester's biographer, however, says that Winchester`` routinely dismissed workers for months at a time 'to take such rest as I might''' and notes that ``this flies in the face of claims by today's Mystery House proprietors that work at the ranch was ceaseless for thirty - eight years. ''", 'In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers.[citation needed] (A 1643 publication said the school\'s purpose was "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust".) It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model—\u200b\u200bmany leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge—\u200b\u200bbut conformed Puritanism. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The 1955 World Series matched the Brooklyn Dodgers against the New York Yankees, with the Dodgers winning the Series in seven games to capture their first championship in franchise history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won in Brooklyn, as the team relocated to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. This was the fifth time in nine years that the Yankees and the Dodgers met in the World Series, with the Yankees having won in 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953; the Yankees would also win in the 1956 rematch.', "Real Madrid hold the record for the most overall titles, with 22 followed by Milan's 17 titles. Spanish teams hold the record for the most wins in each of the three main UEFA club competitions: Real Madrid, with thirteen European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles; Sevilla, with five UEFA Cup / UEFA Europa League titles; and Barcelona, with four Cup Winners' Cup titles. Milan share the most Super Cup wins (five) with Barcelona, and the most Intercontinental Cup wins (three) with Real Madrid. German clubs Hamburg, Schalke 04 and Stuttgart, and Spanish club Villarreal are the record holders by titles won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup (twice each)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: In a typical La Liga season, there are 38 matchdays. This is likely to be the structure during the years Barcelona won titles in both 1948 and 1949. Each team plays against every other team twice (home and away), leading to a total of 38 games in a season.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months -- a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March / early April to late September / early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 261⁄2 weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day. It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games in the League Championship Series / World Series).', 'Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Jim Wilson played for the Minnesota Twins, a team in Major League Baseball (MLB). The regular MLB season typically begins in late March or early April. For the 2018 season, all teams were scheduled to open on Thursday, March 29. This suggests that in the context of Jim Wilson's era in MLB, opening days would have likely fallen in a similar time frame.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The card consisted of twelve matches, including two on the pre-show. In the main event, Dolph Ziggler retained the Intercontinental Championship by defeating Seth Rollins 5 -- 4 in an Iron Man match that went into sudden death overtime. This was the first time that an Intercontinental Championship match was the main event of a WWE pay - per - view since Backlash in 2001. In the penultimate match, AJ Styles retained the WWE Championship against Rusev. On the undercard, Alexa Bliss retained the Raw Women's Championship against Nia Jax in an Extreme Rules match, Bobby Lashley defeated Roman Reigns, and Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Jeff Hardy for the United States Championship.", 'The UEFA Euro 2012 Final was a football match that took place on 1 July 2012 at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine, to determine the winner of UEFA Euro 2012. Spain, who had won Euro 2008, successfully defended their title with a 4–0 win over Italy, becoming the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and the first team to win three consecutive major tournaments – Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. It was the greatest margin of victory in the history of the European Championship finals, and the fourth time that teams who played each other in the group stage played each other again in the final (1988, 1996 and 2004).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The wrestler who has held the Intercontinental Championship the most times is Dolph Ziggler. The relevant text indicates that he retained the title in a match in 2008, specifically during a WWE pay-per-view event. However, the information about where this took place is not explicitly stated. Since I have no direct mention of the location of this event (where Ziggler won in 2008), I cannot provide a specific answer.

Direct answer: Unknown

This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as Bays Mountain and Clinch Mountain. The western section of the Tennessee Valley, where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower, is called the Great Valley. In this valley are numerous towns and two of the region's three urban areas, Knoxville, the 3rd largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the 4th largest city in the state. The third urban area, the Tri-Cities, comprising Bristol, Johnson City, and Kingsport and their environs, is located to the northeast of Knoxville."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States as President of the United States Senate. The Constitution also calls for a President pro tempore to serve as the leader of the body when the President of the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President pro tempore -- customarily the most senior (longest - serving) Senator in the majority party -- actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior Senators of the majority party. Since the Vice President may be of a different party than the majority and is not a member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role. For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate. This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.', 'The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes. No Democratic - held seats had fallen to the Republican Party in the 2006 elections. Democrat Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House. The House also received the first Muslim (Keith Ellison) and Buddhist (Hank Johnson and Mazie Hirono) members of Congress.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The party holding the majority in the House of Representatives has the authority to determine the rules of the House and to influence the Senate indirectly since the Vice President acts as the presiding officer in the Senate. The relevant facts indicate that control shifted during certain elections. The Democrats maintained a majority until 2014 when Republicans took control of the Senate, while they had also captured significant control over the House. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Republicans took control of the rules of both chambers following the 2014 elections, which reflected a significant shift in congressional power.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['For years Burke pursued impeachment efforts against Warren Hastings, formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings\' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation. In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the East India Company when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke\'s primary concern. This committee was charged "to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties". While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second \'secret\' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the Indian princes that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the HEIC recall Hastings. This was Burke\'s first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that "began \'in commerce\' but \'ended in empire.\'"', 'Leading to the impeachment, Independent Counsel Ken Starr turned over documentation to the House Judiciary Committee. Chief Prosecutor David Schippers and his team reviewed the material and determined there was sufficient evidence to impeach the president. As a result, four charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868, and only the third against whom articles of impeachment had been brought before the full House for consideration (Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974, while an impeachment process against him was underway).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Warren Hastings, who was the first Governor-General of Bengal, was impeached in England for his actions while in office. The impeachment process began on February 14, 1788, and continued until 1795, with the trial itself occurring during 1786. Given that the question asks for the start of the impeachment, February 14, 1788, is the critical date. 
Direct answer: February 14, 1788

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Ten High is a brand of American whiskey first introduced in the 1930s by Hiram Walker & Sons, now produced by the Barton Brands division of the Sazerac Company. The name "Ten High" refers to a barrel storage location at least ten ricks high, as barrels in the upper part of the aging warehouse mature faster. Although the brand name evoked this storage method, the manufacturer did not actually promise that the brand was from barrels aged in such locations.', "On leaving the University of Oxford, in 1676, Edmond Halley visited Saint Helena and set up an astronomical observatory with a 7.3-metre-long (24 ft) aerial telescope with the intention of studying stars from the Southern Hemisphere. The site of this telescope is near Saint Mathew's Church in Hutt's Gate, in the Longwood district. The 680-metre (2,230 ft) high hill there is named for him and is called Halley's Mount."]

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I recall that Chuck Norris starred in the film "Top Dog," and he also portrayed the main character, Cordell Walker, in the series "Walker, Texas Ranger." Additionally, Judson Mills played Francis Gage in "Walker, Texas Ranger." Therefore, one cast member from "Top Dog" who also appeared in "Walker, Texas Ranger" is Chuck Norris.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.', 'In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County. Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Huguenots in the state encompassing Zubly Cemetery purchased land from British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. This is confirmed by the information about the Huguenot families who migrated and prospered in property speculation after petitioning the British Crown for land ownership.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1936, the couple were returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the rhythm of the ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.", 'In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the Vital Records Office of the states, capital district, territories and former territories. Birth in the U.S. establishes automatic eligibility for American citizenship, so a birth certificate from a local authority is commonly provided to the federal government to obtain a U.S. passport. However, the U.S. State Department does issue a Consular Report of Birth Abroad for children born to U.S. citizens (who are also eligible for citizenship), including births on military bases in foreign territory.']

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: To answer the question, I need to identify the cast member of "Pizza Man" and the show they are currently starring in. "Pizza Man" stars Bill Maher. However, I do not have information specifically regarding the start date of the new season of the show he may be starring in. Therefore, without specific details on the show and its schedule, I cannot provide a conclusive answer.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.", 'Antonio Vivaldi wrote at least three settings of the hymn Gloria in excelsis Deo, whose words date probably from the 4th Century and which is an integral part of the Ordinary of the Mass. Two survive: RV 588 and RV 589. A third, RV 590, is mentioned only in the Kreuzherren catalogue and presumed lost. The RV 589 Gloria is a familiar and popular piece among sacred works by Vivaldi. It was probably written at about the same time as the RV 588, possibly in 1715.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The composer of "Gloria in D Major" is Antonio Vivaldi. He was born in Venice. Based on the provided information about plague occurrences, Venice had outbreaks 22 times between 1361 and 1528. Therefore, the number of times plague occurred in the birthplace of Vivaldi is specifically identified as 22 times.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The U.S. Congress first established a Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1884 with the Bureau of Labor Act, to collect information about labor and employment. This bureau was under the Department of the Interior. The Bureau started collecting economic data in 1884, and published their first report in 1886. Later, the Bureau of Labor became an independent Department of Labor but lacked executive rank. It became a bureau again within the Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established February 15, 1903. President William Howard Taft signed the March 4, 1913 (the last day of his presidency) bill, establishing the Department of Labor as a Cabinet - level Department. William B. Wilson was appointed as the first Secretary of Labor on March 5, 1913 by President Wilson. Secretary Wilson chaired the first meeting of the International Labour Organization in October 1919, even though the U.S. was not yet a member.', 'The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is a United States labor law requiring covered employers to provide employees with job - protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. These include pregnancy, adoption, foster care placement of a child, personal or family illness, or family military leave. The FMLA is administered by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.', "Xiamen dialect, sometimes known as Amoy, is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an, both of which are now included in the Greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant texts indicate that Chen Zheng, along with his son Chen Yuanguang, led a military expedition in 677 to pacify a rebellion in Fujian. This was followed by the efforts of Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi in 885 to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. Since the Min dialects are spoken in Fujian province, where the military expeditions took place, it's clear that these leaders were instrumental in establishing the presence of the Middle Chinese phonology that influenced the Min dialects, especially in the region along the borders with Zhejiang.

QUESTION: What was the population density of Tammy Leitner's city of birth in 2009?
CRUCIAL ITEMS: {'Tammy Leitner': 2, 'city of birth': 3, 'population density': 3, '2009': 2}

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['After a trend of declining population density since World War II, the city has seen increased density in the inner and western suburbs, aided in part by Victorian Government planning, such as Postcode 3000 and Melbourne 2030 which have aimed to curtail urban sprawl. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics as of June 2013, inner city Melbourne had the highest population density with 12,400 people per km2. Surrounding inner city suburbs experienced an increase in population density between 2012 and 2013; Carlton (9,000 people per km2) and Fitzroy (7,900).', 'The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant facts do not provide specific information regarding the population density of Tammy Leitner's city of birth in 2009. Although some cities are mentioned with population densities and descriptions, none explicitly relate to her birth city or identify it clearly. As such, because there is not sufficient data to derive the population density for her birth city, I am unable to provide an answer.

Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President. Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and, when activated, as a reserve of the U.S. Army under the authority of the President.', 'In 1968, Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubček needed help in facing down the Soviets. In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gošnjak and Rade Hamović in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The country referred to in the question is Yugoslavia, which had an unprepared military (the Rok Army) during the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The word "Slavs" was used in the national anthem of Yugoslavia. The relevant information confirms that "Slavs" was present in the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since the question does not specify a date, the usage of "Slavs" in the anthem aligns with the anthems adopted around the time of Yugoslavia's establishment, which is linked to its historical context without precise dating. I am relating the word "Slavs" directly to the anthem without a specific mentioning of dates but acknowledging it was included in the anthem historically.

Direct answer: In the national anthem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Song offers no clue to its author or to the date, place, or circumstances of its composition. The superscription states that it is ``Solomon's '', but even if this is meant to identify the author, it can not be read as strictly as a similar modern statement. The most reliable evidence for its date is its language: Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew after the end of the Babylonian exile in the late 6th century BCE, and the evidence of vocabulary, morphology, idiom and syntax clearly points to a late date, centuries after King Solomon to whom it is traditionally attributed. It has parallels with Mesopotamian and Egyptian love poetry from the first half of the 1st millennium, and with the pastoral idylls of Theocritus, a Greek poet who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century; as a result of these conflicting signs, speculation ranges from the 10th to the 2nd centuries BCE, with the language supporting a date around the 3rd century.", "Edward Winslow (18 October 1595 -- 8 May 1655) was a Separatist who traveled on the Mayflower in 1620. He was one of several senior leaders on the ship and also later at Plymouth Colony. Both Edward Winslow and his brother, Gilbert Winslow signed the Mayflower Compact. In Plymouth he served in a number of governmental positions such as assistant governor, three times was governor and also was the colony's agent in London. In early 1621 he had been one of several key leaders on whom Governor Bradford depended after the death of John Carver. He was the author of several important pamphlets, including Good Newes from New England and co-wrote with William Bradford the historic Mourt's Relation, which ends with an account of the First Thanksgiving and the abundance of the New World. In 1655 he died of fever while on a British naval expedition in the Caribbean against the Spanish. He is the only Plymouth colonist with an extant portrait, and this can be seen at Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth, Massachusetts."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Pacem in Terris was authored by Pope John XXIII. He died in 1963. The governor of the city where he died (likely Rome) is not specified, but we can infer that it is related to the governance of the Vatican City. However, the specific ending year of the sitting governor is not provided. Therefore, I consider the question about the ending year as not precisely defined.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Longest Night in Shanghai () is a 2007 film produced by Japan's Movie Eye Entertainment and directed by Chinese director Zhang Yibai. It is a rare collaboration between China and Japan.", "On December 8, 1941, the United States Congress declared war (Public Law 77 - 328, 55 STAT 795) on the Empire of Japan in response to that country's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor the prior day. It was formulated an hour after the Infamy Speech of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Japan had sent a message for the United States to its embassy in Washington earlier, but because of problems at the embassy in decoding the very long message -- the high security level assigned to the declaration meant that only personnel with very high clearances could decode it, which slowed down the process -- it was not delivered to the U.S. Secretary of State until after the Pearl Harbor attack. Following the U.S. declaration, Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States, bringing the United States fully into World War II."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The film "The Longest Night in Shanghai" was produced by Japan. You Wenhui was born in Shanghai, which is in China. The USA declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941, in response to the Pearl Harbor attack. Therefore, the direct answer to the question is the date of this declaration of war against the country that produced the film, Japan.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Soonchunhyang University (SCH) is a private university in South Korea, founded in 1978. It is located in the city of Asan, South Chungcheong province, about 52 miles (88\xa0km) southwest of Seoul. It was founded by Dr. Succ-Jo Suh in 1978 as a medical college with 80 students, but expanded to become a comprehensive university in 1980, offering both undergraduate and graduate programs. In 2009, the university was ranked 31st among all South Korean universities in a comprehensive evaluation by the JoongAng Ilbo. It was also ranked 151st among Asia-Pacific universities by Chosun-QS Asia in 2010.', "The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), located in Mexico City, is the largest university on the continent, with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds. Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centres. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006, making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.', "The Acura RLX is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured by Honda and sold under their Acura division, released in 2013. Succeeding the Acura RL, the RLX offers two versions, a front-wheel drive base model equipped with Acura's Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS) four-wheel steering system, and a hybrid variant featuring SH-AWD that serves as Acura's flagship. The JDM version, the Honda Legend, is only offered with the SH-AWD powertrain."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant information indicates that Nissan, along with Honda (the creator of the Hino Dutro) and the maker of the Acura Legend, opened US assembly plants around the same time in response to economic conditions. Specifically, this action occurred after the 1981 voluntary export restraints affected Japanese automakers, leading them to establish domestic production as a strategy to circumvent these restrictions.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.', 'During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Tucson metro area is served by many local television stations and is the 68th largest designated market area (DMA) in the U.S. with 433,310 homes (0.39% of the total U.S.). It is limited to the three counties of southeastern Arizona (Pima, Santa Cruz, and Cochise) The major television networks serving Tucson are: KVOA 4 (NBC), KGUN 9 (ABC), KMSB-TV 11 (Fox), KOLD-TV 13 (CBS), KTTU 18 (My Network TV) and KWBA 58 (The CW). KUAT-TV 6 is a PBS affiliate run by the University of Arizona (as is sister station KUAS 27).', 'Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors. In the following season, under coach Luis, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. However, Maradona's time with Barcelona was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua Bucureşti during a dramatic evening in Seville.", "Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['True Grit is a 2010 American Revisionist Western film directed, written, produced, and edited by the Coen brothers and executively produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously released in 1969 starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell. This version stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Deputy U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.', 'Rooster Cogburn is a 1975 American Western adventure film directed by Stuart Millar and starring John Wayne (in his penultimate film), reprising his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, and Katharine Hepburn. Written by Martha Hyer, based on the character Rooster Cogburn created by Charles McColl Portis in his 1968 western novel "True Grit", the film is about an aging one-eyed lawman whose badge was recently suspended for a string of routine arrests that ended in bloodshed. To earn back his badge, he is tasked with bringing down a ring of bank robbers that has hijacked a wagon shipment of nitroglycerin. He is helped by a spinster searching for her father\'s killer. "Rooster Cogburn" is a sequel to the 1969 film "True Grit".']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The film "Rooster Cogburn" features John Wayne reprising his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, a character originally created in the novel "True Grit." The 1969 film "True Grit" starred John Wayne in the same role, making it clear that the same character is central to both films. Therefore, the cast member from "Rooster Cogburn," John Wayne, played U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn in "True Grit."

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The occupation of the Baltic states was the military occupation of the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- by the Soviet Union under the auspices of the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact on 14 June 1940 followed by their incorporation into the USSR as constituent republics, unrecognised by most Western powers. On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the USSR and within weeks occupied the Baltic territories. In July 1941, the Baltic territory was incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland of the Third Reich. As a result of the Baltic Offensive of 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and trapped the remaining German forces in the Courland pocket until their formal surrender in May 1945. The Soviet ``annexation occupation ''(Annexionsbesetzung or occupation sui generis) of the Baltic states lasted until August 1991, when the Baltic states regained independence.", 'Villa Welgelegen is a historical building in Haarlem, the Netherlands, which currently houses the offices of the provincial executives of North Holland.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.', 'Malaysia-based Yazhou Zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the China Seismological Bureau Geng Qingguo (耿庆国), in which Geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the State Seismological Bureau on April 30, 2008, warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture region of Sichuan around May 8, with a range of 10 days before or after the quake. Geng, while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community, believed that "the bigger the earthquake, the easier it is to predict." Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng\'s work. Geng\'s drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972, and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes. The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes. In response, an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that "earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint." The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant information identifies that Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) proposed explanations for the origins of earthquakes and the formation of mountains. Additionally, he is referred to as one of the greatest thinkers. Thus, it can be inferred that those who regard him as one of the greatest thinkers also recognize his contributions in these areas.
Direct answer: Ibn Sina

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Just Be Free is a demo album released by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on "The New Mickey Mouse Club", a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music with the understanding that they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera\'s vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and "Just Be Free" has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.', 'Study in Brown (EmArcy Records, 1955) is a Clifford Brown and Max Roach album. The album consists predominantly of originals by members of the band. The songs "Lands End", by tenor saxophonist Harold Land, and "Sandu", by Brown, have gone on to become jazz standards. The song "George\'s Dilemma" is also known as "Ulcer Department". Brown\'s solo on "Cherokee" is among the most acclaimed solos in jazz.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The album "Study in Brown" was released by EmArcy Records in 1955. Since the explorer's timeline relative to reaching the headquarters of the record label is not provided in the relevant facts, and no specific date is mentioned, I cannot determine when the explorer reached that location.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Palau Güell (, ) is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaudí for the industrial tycoon Eusebi Güell and built between 1886 and 1888. It is situated on the Carrer Nou de la Rambla, in the El Raval neighbourhood of the city of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Works of Antoni Gaudí".', 'The Museu d\'Art Jaume Morera (Jaume Morera Art Museum) is a museum in Lleida (Catalonia) created by the Diputació de Lleida and the Lleida City Council ("La Paeria") with the collaboration of the painter Jaume Morera i Galícia.

Today is municipally owned and receives financial support from the "Diputació de Lleida" and the Department of Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia. Its entrance is free.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: First, I need to identify the region where Codo is located. Codo is in Aragon, Spain. Then, I find out about a historical figure named Martin from that region and see the connection. In this context, Martin the Humane was a ruler who died; it's pertinent to locate the city where he died. Additionally, I need to determine when the Palau de la Generalitat was constructed. The data indicates that the Palau de la Generalitat was built in the 15th century. Hence, I can conclude that Martin from the region where Codo is located died in the same period when the Palau de la Generalitat was constructed in the city where he died, which was Valencia. The specific construction year for the Palau de la Generalitat aligns with the timeframe of Martin's death, so I acknowledge the 15th century construction date.

Direct answer: 15th century

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Mount Bosworth is located in the Canadian Rockies on the border of Alberta and British Columbia. The mountain is situated immediately northwest of Kicking Horse Pass and straddles the shared border of Banff National Park with Yoho National Park. It was named in 1903 after George Morris Bosworth, an executive and long-time employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway.', "Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator. In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General.The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands; Australian Antarctic Territory; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Coral Sea Islands; Heard Island and McDonald Islands; and Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 334 BC, Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid emperor, Darius III, at the Battle of Issus. Following the premature death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. In the middle of the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran, and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between Romans and Parthians began, culminating in the Roman–Parthian Wars. The Parthian Empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries, until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire. Together with their neighboring arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantines, they made up the world's two most dominant powers at the time, for over four centuries.", "In 376, the Ostrogoths, fleeing from the Huns, received permission from Emperor Valens (r. 364–378) to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans. The settlement did not go smoothly, and when Roman officials mishandled the situation, the Ostrogoths began to raid and plunder.[D] Valens, attempting to put down the disorder, was killed fighting the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378. As well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north, internal divisions within the empire, especially within the Christian Church, caused problems. In 400, the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and, although briefly forced back from Italy, in 410 sacked the city of Rome. In 406 the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi crossed into Gaul; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern-day Spain. The Migration Period began, where various people, initially largely Germanic peoples, moved across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni, and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes settled in Britain. In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire; their king Attila (r. 434–453) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451, and Italy in 452. The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart. These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire in 334 BC. Based on the historical records, he died prematurely after his campaigns. The exact year of his death is 323 BC, which follows his invasion in 334 BC by about 11 years. 
Direct answer: 323 BC

On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history.", 'North Bend is a city in Coos County, Oregon, United States with a population of 9,695 as of the 2010 census.

Therefore, I will state "Unknown" as I can't find definitive data for the 2018 population of Venice.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The early Qing military was rooted in the Eight Banners first developed by Nurhaci to organize Jurchen society beyond petty clan affiliations. There were eight banners in all, differentiated by color. The yellow, bordered yellow, and white banners were known as the "Upper Three Banners" and were under the direct command of the emperor. Only Manchus belonging to the Upper Three Banners, and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of martial exams could serve as the emperor\'s personal bodyguards. The remaining Banners were known as the "Lower Five Banners." They were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi\'s immediate family, known informally as the "Iron cap princes". Together they formed the ruling council of the Manchu nation as well as high command of the army. Nurhachi\'s son Hong Taiji expanded the system to include mirrored Mongol and Han Banners. After capturing Beijing in 1644, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by the Green Standard Army, made up of those Ming troops who had surrendered to the Qing, which eventually outnumbered Banner troops three to one. They maintained their Ming era organization and were led by a mix of Banner and Green Standard officers.[citation needed]', 'In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The fight between Ming loyalists and Manchus occurred during the transition of power from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. Among the notable leaders from the Ming loyalists was Zheng Jing in the Kingdom of Tungning. As the Qing forces advanced, notable Manchu leaders such as Wu Sangui and Dorgon were part of the military efforts against the Ming loyalists. However, the text indicates that Wu Sangui was caught between the rebel forces led by Li Zicheng and the invading Manchus. Ultimately, after the fall of Beijing, which was taken by the Manchus, various military expeditions took place led by local leaders. However, Zheng Jing is explicitly noted for representing Ming loyalist efforts.

It is his third full studio album, or the fourth if including the instrumental work Labo M which he had released earlier the same year. The title of the album and its best known track means 'Which of Us Two' reflecting the ongoing contrast between Chedid's real persona and that of his invented character -M-. The album's liner notes explain that the love discussed in that song are for the pink guitar that features on both the album cover and the surreal music video that accompanied the song. The pink guitar had been specially created to celebrate the birth of Chedid's daughter Billie in 2002.", 'The ballets of the late 19th Century -- particularly of those of Marius Petipa -- introduced the concept of the grand pas de deux, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of entrée and adagio by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale. During the 20th century, the grand pas de deux became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.", 'Al gran sole carico d\'amore ("In the Bright Sunshine Heavy with Love") is an opera (designated as an \'azione scenica\') with music by Luigi Nono, based mainly on plays by Bertolt Brecht, but also incorporating texts of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Karl Marx, and Vladimir Lenin. Nono himself and Yuri Lyubimov wrote the libretto. It premiered at the Teatro alla Scala on 4 April 1975, conducted by Claudio Abbado. Lyubimov directed the original production. The UK premiere was at the 32nd Edinburgh Festival in 1978. In addition to vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra, the work incorporates taped sounds. This work is a product of Nono\'s strong political activism through the mid-1970s.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The composer of "Al gran sole carico d'amore," Luigi Nono, is associated with works in Venice. According to the data, the plague occurred in Venice 22 times between the years of 1361 and 1528. Therefore, this is the relevant location in relation to the composer.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.', "Ford South Africa was based in Port Elizabeth (now part of the Eastern Cape province) and had been operating since 1923. In the early 1980s, it had both a vehicle assembly plant and an engine plant in Struandale, together with an older assembly plant in Neave. After the merger with Sigma and the formation of Samcor, the engine plant continued to be operated by Samcor and in 2015 is still operating under Ford ownership. Both the assembly plants were closed and all vehicle production transferred to Samcor's Silverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria. The Struandale assembly plant was subsequently sold to Delta Motor Corporation (General Motors)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: According to the information, Nissan opened US assembly plants around the same time as other Japanese automakers in response to market conditions and the 1981 voluntary export restraints. This event is mentioned to have occurred in the early 1980s. Therefore, I can conclude that Nissan began building its US plants during that timeframe.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['True Grit is a 2010 American Revisionist Western film directed, written, produced, and edited by the Coen brothers and executively produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously released in 1969 starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell. This version stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Deputy U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.', "For the second consecutive year, the field of major nominees included at least one blockbuster at the American and Canadian box offices. However, only three of the nominees had grossed over $100 million before the nominations were announced, compared with five from the previous year. The combined gross of the ten Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $1.2 billion, the second-highest ever behind 2009. The average gross was $119.3 million.Two of the ten Best Picture nominees were among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. At the time of the announcement of nominations on January 25, Toy Story 3 was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $414.9 million in domestic box office receipts. The only other top ten box office hit to receive a nomination was Inception which earned $292.5 million. Among the remaining eight nominees, True Grit was the next-highest-grossing film with $137.9 million followed by The Social Network ($95.4  million), Black Swan $83.2 million, The Fighter ($72.6 million), The King's Speech ($57.3 million), The Kids Are All Right ($20.8 million), 127 Hours ($11.2 million), and finally Winter's Bone ($6.2 million).Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 55 nominations went to 15 films on the list.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War, and the British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.", "A total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Real Madrid winning the title a record 33 times and Barcelona 25 times. After Athletic Bilbao claimed several titles in the league's early years, Real Madrid dominated the championship from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when Athletic and neighbours Real Sociedad each won the league twice. From the 1990s onwards, Barcelona (15 titles) and Real Madrid (9 titles) were both prominent, though La Liga also saw other champions, including Atlético Madrid, Valencia, and Deportivo de La Coruña. In the 2010s, Atlético Madrid became increasingly strong, forming a trio alongside Real Madrid and Barcelona which occupied the podium places exclusively."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Greek surnames were widely in use by the 9th century supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father’s name, however Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons. Although surnames in mainland Greece are static today, dynamic and changing patronymic usage survives in middle names where the genitive of father's first name is commonly the middle name (this usage having been passed on to the Russians). In Cyprus, by contrast, surnames follow the ancient tradition of being given according to the father’s name. Finally, in addition to Greek-derived surnames many have Latin, Turkish and Italian origin.", 'Charlemagne\'s court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the "Carolingian Renaissance". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne\'s chancery—or writing office—made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: To determine the origin of the last name "Sylvester" in relation to Rotrude's father, we first identify Rotrude's father. Rotrude is a Frankish princess and is the daughter of Charlemagne. The era during which Charlemagne ruled is known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The last name "Sylvester" has its roots in the Latin word "Silvester," which means "wooded" or "wild," and is derived from "silva," meaning "forest." Thus, the last name "Sylvester" relates to the Latin heritage of the Carolingian Renaissance.

Direct answer: Carolingian Renaissance

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["While varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. Real Madrid C.F. and FC Barcelona are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. The country's national football team won the UEFA European Football Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.", 'The outreach director of HRTR, Susan Prager, is also the communication director of "Friends of Falun Gong", a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr.

A major setback to the event was caused by footballer Diego Maradona, scheduled to open the relay through Buenos Aires, pulling out in an attempt to avoid the Olympic controversy. Trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the UK, France and the US, the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay, involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people, including public employees and volunteers. Overall, the protests were peaceful in nature, although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the Olympic flame, and minor scuffles between Olympic protesters and supporters from Chinese immigrant communities.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The football star who backed out due to the relay controversy is Diego Maradona. However, there is no information available in my memory regarding the specific date when he was signed by Barcelona. Given the data available, I cannot provide a concrete answer about when he was signed.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Family Guy's seventh season first aired on the Fox network in sixteen episodes from September 28, 2008 to May 17, 2009 before being released as two DVD box sets and syndicated. The animated television series follows the dysfunctional Griffin family (father Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie and their anthropomorphic dog Brian), who reside in the town of Quahog. The show features the voices of series creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Mila Kunis in the roles of the Griffin family. The executive producers for the seventh season were MacFarlane, Danny Smith, David Goodman and Chris Sheridan. Goodman and Sheridan served as showrunners for season seven.", 'Friends with Benefits is a 2011 American romantic comedy film directed by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in the lead roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding sex to their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it each time they are together.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I recall that Mila Kunis voices the character Meg Griffin in Family Guy. However, before Mila Kunis took on this role, the character was originally voiced by Lacey Chabert. Since the question asks specifically for the original voice, I will confirm that Lacey Chabert was the one who provided the voice for Meg Griffin before Mila Kunis.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["McCauley Mountain (also known as McAuley Mountain or McCauley's Mountain) is a mountain in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Its official elevation is above sea level. The mountain is a synclinal mountain. Main rock formations on and near it include the Mauch Chunk Formation and the Pottsville Formation. There are also coal deposits on it. The coal deposits were discovered in 1826 and mining of them began in the 1850s. However, coal mining on the east side of the mountain proved to be a commercial failure. There are a number of ponds on the mountain, some of which were created during the mining. However, others are natural vernal pools. Some of the ponds are surrounded by hemlocks and deciduous trees. Major streams near the mountain include Scotch Run, Beaver Run, and Catawissa Creek. The mountain is named after Alexander McCauley, who settled there in 1774.", "Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator. In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General.The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands; Australian Antarctic Territory; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Coral Sea Islands; Heard Island and McDonald Islands; and Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: McCauley Mountain is located in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. The question asks about mountains visible from Portland, which is situated in Oregon. The notable mountains that can be seen from Portland include Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and the Cascade Range. Since Columbia County is not related to Oregon, I will provide the mountains that can be seen from Portland regardless of McCauley Mountain's location. 
Direct answer: Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, Cascade Range
TRUE ANSWER: Tualatin Mountains

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. London Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, is the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways. In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened. There were plans for a third runway and a sixth terminal; however, these were cancelled by the Coalition Government on 12 May 2010.", "Orly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993. Today it is the 4th busiest airport in the world by international traffic, and is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France.  Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located 69 km (43 mi) north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Georgia, formally the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (Georgian SSR; ; ), was one of the republics of the Soviet Union from its inception in 1922 to its breakup in 1991. Coterminous with the present-day republic of Georgia, it was based on the traditional territory of Georgia, which had existed as a series of independent states in the Caucasus prior to annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801. Independent again as the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918, it was annexed by Soviet forces, who invaded it in 1921. The Georgian SSR was subsequently formed, though from 1922 until 1936 it was a part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, which existed as a union republic within the USSR. From November 18, 1989, the Georgian SSR declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. The republic was renamed the Republic of Georgia on November 14, 1990, and subsequently became independent before the dissolution of the Soviet Union on April 9, 1991, whereupon each former SSR became a sovereign state.', 'The Warsaw Pact, formally known as the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, was a collective defence treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland among the Soviet Union and seven Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the individual responsible for suspending the party that would have maintained power if the treaty was signed in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From the relevant facts, it is noted that Boris Yeltsin played a significant role in the political shifts during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and he specifically suspended the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Horst Teltschik, Kohl's foreign policy advisor, later recalled that Germany would have paid ``100 billion deutschmarks ''if the Soviets demanded it. The USSR did not make such great demands, however, with Gorbachev stating in February 1990 that`` The Germans must decide for themselves what path they choose to follow''. In May 1990 he repeated his remark in the context of NATO membership while meeting Bush, amazing both the Americans and Germans. This removed the last significant roadblock to Germany being free to choose its international alignments, though Kohl made no secret that he intended for the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats in NATO and the EC.", "Hero of Socialist Labour () was an honorary title in Albania and other Warsaw Pact countries. It was the highest degree of distinction for exceptional achievements in national economy and culture. It provided a similar status to the title People's Hero of Albania that was awarded for heroic deeds, but unlike the latter, was awarded to citizens who contributed to the development of Albania's industry, agriculture, transportation, trade, science and technology and promoted the might and the glory of Albania."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The country controlling the group of nations, which included the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, was the USSR. Gorbachev made remarks regarding the reunification of Germany and NATO membership in February and May of 1990. This is when the last significant roadblock to Germany's international alignments was removed. Eisenhower would not discuss NATO during his campaign, as it was a different era. The agreement for a unified Germany, therefore, directly relates to Gorbachev's statements in 1990.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["One Night in America is the twenty first studio album by American blues singer and harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite. It was released in February 2002 on Telarc record label and it was Musselwhite's debut and only release on this label.", "The song was written by Eagles' members Randy Meisner, Don Henley and Glenn Frey. Meisner, who sang lead on it, says the song began as his solo composition. As it remained unfinished when time came for the One of These Nights album to be recorded, Henley and Frey assisted Meisner in completing it. Meisner's performance of the song was popular with the audience in Eagles' concerts, but disputes over his reluctance to perform it would also directly lead to Meisner's departure from the band."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Mud Bath is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by David Bomberg. The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period. Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist.", 'Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W. Nevinson and Dora Carrington. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Avery Brundage (; September 28, 1887\xa0– May 8, 1975) was the fifth President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), serving from 1952 to 1972. The only American to attain that position, Brundage is remembered as a zealous advocate of amateurism and for his involvement with the 1936 and 1972 Summer Olympics, both held in Germany.', "Avery's mother Diana (Mary Steenburgen) arrives to make sure that the TV movie about her daughter shows her in a good light. Liz (Tina Fey) promises to help Jack (Alec Baldwin) overcome his chemistry with Diana and keep him out of an inappropriate relationship. Liz eventually fixes Diana up with the actor playing Jack (William Baldwin, Alec Baldwin's real life brother) to keep her away from Jack. At the table reading of Liz's script, Jack is appalled that Liz has included some seedy details about Jack and Avery's courtship. He fires Liz from the project and rewrites the script himself. Jack eventually realizes that Liz is right that he had been idealizing his relationship with Avery. Liz consoles him and helps him rewrite the script to be a total fabrication."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Avery Brundage was the fifth president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). According to the facts in my memory, the current president of the IOC is Thomas Bach, who has served since September 10, 2013. Therefore, I can conclude that Thomas Bach is the president of the organization of which Avery Brundage was a member.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.', 'USB device communication is based on pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it\'s rare to have so many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The device that was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals refers to USB. Based on the specifications, the maximum load a USB device can draw varies depending on the version. In USB 1.x and 2.0, a device can draw a maximum of 5 unit loads, which equals 500 mA. In USB 3.0, a device can draw a maximum of 6 unit loads, which equals 900 mA. Since the question refers to the overall maximum load drawn by the device across its versions, USB 3.0, with a maximum load of 900 mA, represents the highest value.

Direct answer: 900 mA
TRUE ANSWER: five unit loads

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into the first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty in 224 AD, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than four centuries.", 'The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.", 'Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The arguer who claimed that Yekaterina Fesenko's country of citizenship (the Soviet Union) had become an imperialist power is identified as Mao Zedong, who expressed his intentions regarding the Korean conflict. In my memory, one relevant reference to his commitment refers to the Korean conflict, where it is stated that he agreed to support the North Korean invasion. Therefore, the location where he declared he would intervene aligns with Korea during the invasion by North Korean forces.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Wayne Gretzky won the award a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. He has been named MVP more times than any other player in the history of the other three North American major professional leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association, and National Football League). Barry Bonds is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.', "It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare. Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues, like Chicago's Crosstown Classic and New York's Subway Series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play. The annual MLB All-Star Game, played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, was long considered an exhibition match, but as of 2003 this status was questioned because the league whose team wins the All-Star game has been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming World Series."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The MLB MVP award is given in Major League Baseball (MLB). The team that has played the most games would be a team in this league. Regular season games in MLB typically begin in late March or early April. Based on memory, there is a mention that the earliest domestic start for MLB could be March 29. Therefore, for the season when considering the start date for the league associated with the MVP, the regular season starts around this date.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega, which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988. Nintendo\'s intention, however, was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers\' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo\'s "iron-clad terms" made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami\'s Ultra Games label; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.', 'During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami\'s "Ultra Games" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega\'s console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo\'s other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant facts indicate that during the NES era, Nintendo had a limit on the number of games that third-party developers could release per year. This limit was specifically set at five games per developer. The game Xexyz was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, abbreviated as NES. Therefore, the limit on games per developer per year for the NES platform is five.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes. No Democratic - held seats had fallen to the Republican Party in the 2006 elections. Democrat Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House. The House also received the first Muslim (Keith Ellison) and Buddhist (Hank Johnson and Mazie Hirono) members of Congress.', 'In the United Kingdom, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch. The House of Commons is composed of 650 (soon to be 600) members who are directly elected by British citizens to represent single - member constituencies. The leader of a Party that wins more than half the seats, or less than half but is able to gain the support of smaller parties to achieve a majority in the house is invited by the Monarch to form a government. The House of Lords is a body of long - serving, unelected members: Lords Temporal - 92 of whom inherit their titles (and of whom 90 are elected internally by members of the House to lifetime seats), 588 of whom have been appointed to lifetime seats, and Lords Spiritual - 26 bishops, who are part of the house while they remain in office.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The body that approves members of the American Cabinet is the Senate. The majority party in the Senate was the Democratic Party, which regained control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections, marking a significant shift in party control. This was noted as the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995 that the Democrats achieved a majority in both chambers of Congress. Therefore, the majority party gained control of the House in 2006.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"I Remember Love" is a song written by Peter Hallström and Sarah Dawn Finer, and performed by Sarah Dawn Finer at Melodifestivalen 2007. The song participated in the semifinal in Gävle on 24 February 2007, and reached the finals in the Stockholm Globe Arena on 10 March 2007, where it ended up 4th.', 'Popular Spanish singer Sergio Dalma followed 2011\'s four-times platinum "Via Dalma II" with "Cadore 33." Unlike Dalma\'s previous two albums, which consisted of Spanish-language covers of Italian songs, this marked his return to performing original material.']

However, there are no indications of other competitions linked to "Cadore 33" beyond that participation in Eurovision. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this is the competition he is associated with in terms of participation.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on the ``Indoor League ''television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host Fred Trueman during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.", "``Like a G6 ''is a 2010 song written and performed by Far East Movement, The Cataracs, and Dev, with the latter two being credited as featured artists. It is the lead single from Far East Movement's third studio album Free Wired, and production was handled by The Cataracs. For the chorus, Dev samples a verse from her own single`` Booty Bounce'', which was also written and produced by the Cataracs."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The performer of "Don't Be Cruel" is Bobby Brown. In "The Wire," Bobby Brown's character does not appear in the show, so he has no role in it.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, recommended the establishment of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams, who had already gained extensive experience in commando warfare in Korea; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.", 'The first major warship produced by the U.S. Navy after World War II (and in the Cold War) were "frigates"—the ships were originally designated destroyer leaders but reclassified in 1975 as guided missile cruisers (except the became guided missile destroyers). These grew out of the last all-gun destroyers of the 1950s. In the middle 1970s the s entered service, optimized for anti-submarine warfare. A special class of guided missile destroyers was produced for the Shah of Iran, but due to the Iranian Revolution these ships could not be delivered and were added to the U.S. Navy.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The relevant information does not provide a specific acronym for "SEAL" in relation to a list of destroyer classes. However, it is known that "Navy SEALs" refers to the Navy's elite special forces, with "SEAL" commonly understood to mean "Sea, Air, and Land". This context does not clarify its application to destroyer classes, as the connection between the terms is not definitively established. Thus, I will conclude that I do not have enough information to provide a specific acronym representation in this context.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['As of 2018, NL players have won the award 27 times (including one award shared by two players), and American League (AL) players have won 30 times. Baltimore Orioles players have won the most awards for a single franchise (with six); players from the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants are tied for the most in the NL with five each. Five players have won the award twice: Willie Mays (1963, 1968), Steve Garvey (1974, 1978), Gary Carter (1981, 1984), Cal Ripken, Jr. (1991, 2001), and Mike Trout (2014, 2015). The award has been shared by multiple players once; Bill Madlock and Jon Matlack shared the award in 1975. Two players have won the award for a game in which their league lost: Brooks Robinson in 1966 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. One pair of awardees were father and son (Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr.), and another were brothers (Roberto Alomar and Sandy Alomar, Jr.). Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim became the first player ever to win the MVP award in back - to - back years in the 86 - year history of the MLB All - Star Game when he accomplished the feat in both 2014 and 2015. Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros is the most recent MLB All - Star Game MVP, winning the award in 2018. Only six players have won the MVP award in the only All - Star Game in which they appeared; LaMarr Hoyt, Bo Jackson, J.D. Drew, Melky Cabrera, Eric Hosmer, and Alex Bregman.', 'MLB Tonight is the signature program that airs on MLB Network and is simulcast on MLB Network Radio.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The team with the most games in the series after which the MLB MVP is awarded refers to the MLB World Series. The MVP for the World Series is distinct from the regular season MVP awards. The Major League Baseball season typically starts with Opening Day, where all teams begin their games. From memory, March 29 was noted as the first time all teams started on the same day for the season. Therefore, the opening day of the league (MLB) is March 29, as it pertains to the league where the team with the most games (such as the New York Yankees or the St. Louis Cardinals, both with numerous World Series games) plays.

Direct answer: March 29

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["After the end of WWII in 1945, the Allies divided the country into a northern area, protected by the Soviets, and a southern area protected primarily by the United States. In 1948, when the powers failed to agree on the formation of a single government, this partition became the modern states of North and South Korea. The peninsula was divided at the 38th Parallel: the ``Republic of Korea ''was created in the south, with the backing of the US and Western Europe, and the`` Democratic People's Republic of Korea'' in the north, with the backing of the Soviets and the communist People's Republic of China. The new premier of North Korea, Kim il - Sung launched the Korean War in 1950 in an attempt to reunify the country under Communist rule. After immense material and human destruction, the conflict ended with a cease - fire in 1953. The two nations officially remain at war because a peace treaty was never signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991.", 'Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The leader who claimed that the republic coming to an end had become an imperialist power is Mao Zedong. It is mentioned that Mao Zedong would intervene in the Korean conflict. Since it is common for leaders to make announcements regarding military intervention at significant political venues, the context suggests this could have occurred at a major international forum like the United Nations conference. However, the specific location of his declaration is not clear in the provided information. Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: the Politburo

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Hero High was a cartoon and live action series created by Filmation that aired as part of NBC\'s "The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!" It was about a high school where young superheroes were taught how to use their powers and fight crime. Originally intended to be a new entry in Filmation\'s long-running line of "Archie" cartoon series, the 1981 series was altered at the last minute because the company\'s rights to the "Archie" characters had expired and new characters had to be created.', 'New York Times Youth Forum was a public affairs program, sponsored by "The New York Times" and aired Sundays at 5pm EST on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network from September 14, 1952, to June 14, 1953. The host was Dorothy Gordon (born Dorothy Lerner, 1889-1970), who continued to host the show on WABD from the time the network closed in 1956 until 1958 when it moved to WRCA-TV (now WNBC).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks for a UK label acquired by a company that, along with ABC and the network that hosts Hero High, is another major broadcaster based in New York. Hero High was aired on NBC, which is based in New York. The other major broadcasters identified are CBS and ABC, both headquartered in New York. The relevant fact from my memory states that CBS acquired Oriole Records, which is a UK label. 

Direct answer: Oriole Records
TRUE ANSWER: Oriole Records.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against Germany, Italy, Japan and starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained formal neutrality as made officially in the Quarantine Speech delivered by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937, while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war material through the Lend - Lease Act which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion forces in Iceland. In the Pacific Theater, there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such as the Flying Tigers. The U.S. economic sanctions on Japan, as part of the effort to deter Japanese military aggression in Asia and the Pacific, was a major cause of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.', 'The official policy of the U.S. Government is that Thailand was not an ally of the Axis, and that the United States was not at war with Thailand. The policy of the U.S. Government ever since 1945 has been to treat Thailand not as a former enemy, but rather as a country which had been forced into certain actions by Japanese blackmail, before being occupied by Japanese troops. Thailand has been treated by the United States in the same way as such other Axis-occupied countries as Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Greece, Norway, Poland, and the Netherlands.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The U.S. believes that Thailand, where the birthplace of Yaovabha Bongsanid is located, was forced into certain actions by Japanese blackmail and was subsequently occupied by Japanese troops. This context led to the U.S. perception that Thailand had aided Japan during World War II, despite the U.S. not considering Thailand an ally of the Axis powers. 

Direct answer: U.S. believes Thailand helped Japan due to being forced into certain actions by Japanese blackmail.
TRUE ANSWER: blackmail

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.', "In September 2006, the iTunes Store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of iTunes 7, compatible with the fifth generation iPod with iPod software 1.2 or later. Those games were: Bejeweled, Cubis 2, Mahjong, Mini Golf, Pac-Man, Tetris, Texas Hold 'Em, Vortex, Asphalt 4: Elite Racing and Zuma. Additional games have since been added. These games work on the 6th and 5th generation iPod Classic and the 5th and 4th generation iPod Nano."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals. The iPod began to provide compatibility with USB, which replaced previous interfaces. The fifth generation iPod classic and the iPod nano also moved away from FireWire, indicating they adopted USB. Thus, the changes to incorporate USB represent the generation in which iPods started being compatible with this standardized connection method. 
Direct answer: Fifth generation iPod
TRUE ANSWER: third generation

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Despite Martin Luther\'s harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. "Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety." Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the "Papists" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints\' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:', "While at St Paul's Cathedral Holland delivered a sermon in May 1910 following the death of King Edward VII, titled Death the King of Terrors, in which he explores the natural but seemingly contradictory responses to death: the fear of the unexplained and the belief in continuity. It is from his discussion of the latter that perhaps his best - known writing, Death is nothing at all, is drawn:"]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The person who wanted to reform and address Vincentas Sladkevičius' religion would most likely be Martin Luther, who preached a sermon on Marian devotion and is associated with the Protestant Reformation. He delivered a sermon at Wittenberg before his death. Wittenberg is located in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, in east Germany. However, the question asks about a district rather than a city. The relevant district in this context would be associated with the local government division where Wittenberg is situated. Hence, the district is likely to be the surrounding area encompassing Wittenberg. 

Direct answer: Wittenberg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley massif, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills. In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).", 'núi Cẩn is a mountain of the Xuân Sơn National Park in Phú Thọ Province in northern Vietnam. It is the third highest point in the park at 1144 metres. The Park also contains núi Voi and núi Ten.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: John Phan was born in Vietnam. To determine what region of the country containing Mount Can (which is not directly mentioned in my memory), I need to identify where Mount Can is located. Given the information, the region of Vietnam that encompasses notable landscapes includes the South Central Coast region, which is mentioned as containing multiple locations. However, I can specifically identify that John Phan's full name and specialties in poker indicate a Vietnamese perspective, and his birthplace will likely be associated with broader Vietnamese geographical contexts like the South Central Coast or central Vietnam itself, but without a specific location for Mount Can noted in memory, I must conclude I do not know the nuanced detail of its exact location relevant to the question.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Fabian Wrede class consists of three training ships used by Finnish Navy. The ships are used by the Naval academy of Finland for basic seamanship training, with particular emphasis on navigation in coastal and archipelago waters. The vessels in the class are "Fabian Wrede", "Wilhelm Carpelan" and "Axel von Fersen". All ships were built by Uudenkaupungin työvene Oy and commissioned between 2006 and 2008. The ships will replace the old Heikki class training ships.', '"Crosley"-class high speed transports were high speed transport ships that served in the United States Navy during World War II. Some stayed in commission long enough to serve in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. All of them were converted from s during construction except for , which was converted a year after her construction. After World War II ended, several of the ships were sold to Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Colombia.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Fabian Wrede-class training ships are operated by the Finnish Navy, which did not participate in any major wars during the timeframe of the ships' service, as they were commissioned between 2006 and 2008. The relevant wars would be World War II or the Korean War, but those are not applicable here. Therefore, there is no specific war associated with the operation of these ships.
Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: Winter War

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["From earliest days, Virginia, and Richmond in particular, have welcomed live theatrical performances. From Lewis Hallam's early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest, and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day.", "Ballet is a 1995 American documentary film directed by Frederick Wiseman. It portrays rehearsals, choreography, performances, business transactions, and other day-to-day life of the American Ballet Theatre. Much of the footage dates from the 1992 season. It also includes scenes from the company's European tour, namely in Greece and Copenhagen."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Atlantic City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 37 at the 2010 census. The community is a small mining settlement in a gulch near South Pass in southwestern Wyoming. It was founded as a mining camp following the 1867 gold rush in the region. The town declined following the end of the placer gold rush in the early 1870s, but continued to exist as advances in mining technology allowed further extraction of gold. From the 1960s until 1983, it was the location of US Steel iron ore mine. The town is accessible by gravel roads from nearby Wyoming Highway 28.', 'The Patapsco Swinging Bridge is located in the Avalon/Orange Grove area of Patapsco Valley State Park in central Maryland, United States. It is a suspension bridge consisting of a wooden deck supported by large cables. The Patapsco Valley has a history of "swinging" bridges built for pedestrian travel from one side of the river to the other. The Orange Grove Flour Mill was one such popular crossing and is where the current bridge now stands. The first bridge was built by the Orange Grove Flour Mill for employees to cross the river. The new swinging bridge, built by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, is one of the most well known and most popular attractions at the Patapsco Valley State Park.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Atwell Mill Grove is located in California, which was significant during the gold rush era. The mention of someone who went to the state where Atwell Mill Grove is located suggests that they were in California during the gold rush period. The city associated with the gold rush is likely Sacramento, as it was founded in 1848 after gold was discovered and became a hub for gold miners. Sacramento is a well-known city in California. The question asks for what shares a border with this city. A nearby city that shares a border with Sacramento is West Sacramento. 

Direct answer: West Sacramento

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The last three eruptions at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now - eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of the explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.', 'The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars. One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons) and Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano - British leader who fought against the invading Anglo - Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum, a 9th - century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single - handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question refers to a volcano named after a legendary King featured in the Historia Regum Britanniae. While the text does mention various events related to eruptions, specifically the last major eruption is cited as occurring between 1781 to 1782, and the latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907. Given this context, the reference to the volcano likely pertains to Mount Hood, which is known to have eruptions recorded in historical documents. Therefore, the last eruption would be associated with the major activity noted.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['As of 2018, NL players have won the award 27 times (including one award shared by two players), and American League (AL) players have won 30 times. Baltimore Orioles players have won the most awards for a single franchise (with six); players from the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants are tied for the most in the NL with five each. Five players have won the award twice: Willie Mays (1963, 1968), Steve Garvey (1974, 1978), Gary Carter (1981, 1984), Cal Ripken, Jr. (1991, 2001), and Mike Trout (2014, 2015). The award has been shared by multiple players once; Bill Madlock and Jon Matlack shared the award in 1975. Two players have won the award for a game in which their league lost: Brooks Robinson in 1966 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. One pair of awardees were father and son (Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr.), and another were brothers (Roberto Alomar and Sandy Alomar, Jr.). Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim became the first player ever to win the MVP award in back - to - back years in the 86 - year history of the MLB All - Star Game when he accomplished the feat in both 2014 and 2015. Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros is the most recent MLB All - Star Game MVP, winning the award in 2018. Only six players have won the MVP award in the only All - Star Game in which they appeared; LaMarr Hoyt, Bo Jackson, J.D. Drew, Melky Cabrera, Eric Hosmer, and Alex Bregman.', "In Major League Baseball (MLB), the wild - card teams are the two teams in each of the two leagues (American and National) that have qualified for the postseason despite failing to win their division. Both teams in each league possess the two best winning percentages in their respective league after the three division winners. The wild card was first instituted in MLB in 1994, with one wild - card team per league advancing to the Division Series in the postseason to face a division winner. In 2012, the system was modified to add a second wild - card team per league and pit each league's wild - card teams against each other in a play - in game -- the MLB wild - card game -- the winner of which would then advance to the Division Series and play the team with the best record. This system ensures that the team with the second - best record in each league, after the three division winners and the team with the first - best record in the league that is a non-division winner, will also get a postseason berth, even if it is n't a division champion."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: First, I need to identify which league's member has played in the most championship series. The St. Louis Cardinals appeared in the most World Series with 19 appearances. The Cardinals are part of the National League. Next, I determine when the All-Star Game for that league takes place. The MLB All-Star Game is played annually in July. 

Direct answer: July

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. The New York Marathon is one of the world's largest, and the 2004–2006 events hold the top three places in the marathons with the largest number of finishers, including 37,866 finishers in 2006. The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year. The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club.", "Floyd Joy Mayweather Jr. (born Floyd Joy Sinclair; February 24, 1977) is an American professional boxing promoter and former professional boxer. He competed from 1996 to 2007 and 2009 to 2015, and made a one - fight comeback in 2017. During his career, he held 15 world titles in five weight classes and the lineal championship in four different weight classes (twice at welterweight), and retired with an undefeated record of 50 -- 0, surpassing Rocky Marciano's record of 49 -- 0. As an amateur, Mayweather won a bronze medal in the featherweight division at the 1996 Olympics, three U.S. Golden Gloves championships (at light flyweight, flyweight, and featherweight), and the U.S. national championship at featherweight."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.', "It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes, which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia. The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton. Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The creature that annelid larvae live like is known as "trochophore larvae." In "SpongeBob SquarePants," the character sharing this name is voiced by Mr. Lawrence, who is known for his role as Plankton.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Every major company selling the antipsychotics — Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly's antipsychotic Zyprexa, and the other involved Bextra. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, Geodon; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.", 'Starting in 1910, the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft. In 1910, Mexico was having a civil war, peasant rebels fighting government soldiers. The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property. In 1916, Pancho Villa, a major rebel leader, attacked Columbus, New Mexico, prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917. They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918. The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and other allies. U.S. troops were sent to the Western Front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war. With the armistice in November 1918, the army once again decreased its forces.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks for the last soldier who died from the conflict that saw government involvement in healthcare. This involvement is typically linked to events surrounding the Civil War and its aftermath, where the Freedmen's Bureau was established for medical care. The last surviving soldier related to that era was Albert Henry Woolson, the last surviving member of the Union Army, who died in 1956. However, the soldier who was specifically last connected to a broader conflict involving government healthcare could relate to the world wars. Hence, I would consider Lazare Ponticelli, the last surviving veteran of World War I, who died in 2008. This aligns with the timeline of the involvement of government in healthcare systems during and after those wars. 

Direct answer: Lazare Ponticelli

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Thomas Baring, known as "Tom", was the tenth child (fifth of second marriage) of Henry Baring of Cromer Hall, and younger full brother of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke. Like his brother, Baring was involved in the family banking business, beginning his career in the Liverpool office of Barings Bank. He later moved to New York City to join Kidder Peabody. When, in 1890, Kidder Peabody split its dual Boston-New York firm, Baring became a partner in the separated New York firm. He and another Kidder-Peabody alumnus, George C. Magoun, formed Baring, Magoun. Both houses continued as North American agents for Barings.', 'A member of the influential Baring family, he was the son of Lieutenant-General Charles Baring, son of Henry Bingham Baring, son of Henry Baring, third son of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet. His mother was Helen Graham, daughter of Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet. He was a lifelong resident of the Isle of Wight. He became involved in politics and public affairs at an early age: he was elected president of the Isle of Wight Liberal Union aged 23, was made a Justice of the Peace a year later and was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1897 at the age of 26. In 1898 he became chairman of the Isle of Wight County Council, a position he held for the rest of his life.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.", 'Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The argument that Boris Lagutin's country of citizenship, the Soviet Union, had become an imperialist power relates to the broader context of its involvement in the Korean conflict. The relevant mention is about Mao Zedong, who stated that he would intervene in Korea, reflecting the geopolitical tensions at the time involving the Soviet Union and other communist nations.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["On 9 July 2006, during Mass at Valencia's Cathedral, Our Lady of the Forsaken Basilica, Pope Benedict XVI used, at the World Day of Families, the Santo Caliz, a 1st-century Middle-Eastern artifact that some Catholics believe is the Holy Grail. It was supposedly brought to that church by Emperor Valerian in the 3rd century, after having been brought by St. Peter to Rome from Jerusalem. The Santo Caliz (Holy Chalice) is a simple, small stone cup. Its base was added in Medieval Times and consists of fine gold, alabaster and gem stones.", "Cork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods. The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the Red Abbey. There are two cathedrals in the city; St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the Catholic cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Protestant faith and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect William Burges."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Đakovo Cathedral is located in Đakovo, Croatia. The region named after Saint Peter, the head of the Catholic Church, is associated with Vatican City. Vatican City became its own country on February 11, 1929, with the signing of the Lateran Treaty. While the direct connection to the Đakovo Cathedral is Martin, who is not directly associated with the title of Saint Peter, the country associated with the head of the Catholic Church is clear. Thus, the answer reflects the Vatican's significance.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Battle of Weihaiwei (Japanese: was a battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. It took place between 20 January and 12 February 1895 in Weihai, Shandong Province, China between the forces of the Japan and Qing China. In early January 1895, the Japanese landed forces in eastern Shandong positioning forces behind the Chinese naval base at Weihaiwei. Through a well coordinated offensive of both naval and land forces, the Japanese destroyed the forts and sank much of the Chinese fleet. With the Shandong and Liaoning peninsulas under Japanese control, the option for a pincer attack against the Chinese capital, Beijing, was now a possibility. This strategic threat forced the Chinese to sue for peace and led to the war's end in April 1895.", 'The Axis states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand in World War II, which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the Japanese in 1941, as the Japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern Thailand. The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma, which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier. Also involved were the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang (consisting of most of Manchuria and parts of Inner Mongolia respectively), and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime (which controlled the coastal regions of China).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Japanese forces invaded China during the First Sino-Japanese War, which included a coordinated offensive that secured significant territories, potentially including Guangdong Province. However, I don't have the specific year when Japanese forces reached the city where Wang Yue died or all of Guangdong Province documented clearly in my relevant facts. The available context points primarily to major battles and control during the late 19th century. Specifics on the timeline of events in Guangdong during or just after the war are not fully captured in my resources. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a concrete year for when the Japanese reached Guangdong.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Congress meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 Representatives and 100 Senators. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members representing Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C. in addition to its 435 voting members. Although they can not vote, these members can sit on congressional committees and introduce legislation.', "The One Hundred Fourteenth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017, during the final two full years of Barack Obama's presidency. The 2014 elections gave the Republicans control of the Senate (and control of both houses of Congress) for the first time since the 109th Congress. With 248 seats in the House of Representatives and 54 seats in the Senate, this Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress of 1929 -- 1931."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question pertains to when the majority party in the House of Representatives gained control of both the House and Senate, which have the authority to approve members of the Cabinet. According to the relevant texts, the 2014 elections led to the Republicans gaining control of both the Senate and House of Representatives, marking the first time since the 109th Congress. This control was established on January 3, 2015, when the 114th Congress convened. Thus, the majority party would have effectively gained control at that time.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"Desde El Principio" also came to be the duo\'s final album for the Sony Music Entertainment label, a company they after a series of mergers in various forms had been signed to for some fifteen years (CBS Records Spain, Epic Records Spain, CBS-Epic Spain, eventually a sublabel to Sony Music Spain, today a subsidiary to the multinational Sony BMG Music Entertainment conglomerate). In 2006 Azúcar Moreno returned to their previous label EMI Music for the album "Bailando Con Lola".', "Sony Music Entertainment Inc. (sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials, SME) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America (SCA), a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. In 1929, the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation (ARC) and, in 1938, was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, following ARC's acquisition by CBS. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. In 1987, Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company, and in 1991, renamed it SME. It is the world's second largest recorded music company, after Universal Music Group."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question refers to Gaspar reaching a region that would become the headquarters of a record label, specifically one that is smaller than Universal Music Group, which is noted to be the only larger label than the one that signed "Desde El Principio". "Desde El Principio" was released under Sony Music Entertainment. The relevant information suggests that Gaspar de Portolà camped in the Santa Monica area. However, the exact date Gaspar reached that region is not mentioned in the relevant facts or texts present in my memory, leading to uncertainty regarding the exact date associated with his arrival.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of \'weak\' and \'strong\' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls "applied process thought" to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows "a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening." Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research (2008), and Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.', 'Business @ the Speed of Thought is a book written by Bill Gates and Collins Hemingway in 1999.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Prior to moving its headquarters to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) was the largest company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.", "Stretching west from the Blue Ridge for approximately 55 miles (89 km) is the Ridge and Valley region, in which numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley. This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as Bays Mountain and Clinch Mountain. The western section of the Tennessee Valley, where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower, is called the Great Valley. In this valley are numerous towns and two of the region's three urban areas, Knoxville, the 3rd largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the 4th largest city in the state. The third urban area, the Tri-Cities, comprising Bristol, Johnson City, and Kingsport and their environs, is located to the northeast of Knoxville."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Veoh's headquarters is in San Diego. The Paramour Sessions' performers, Papa Roach, were formed in California.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the Administrator. In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the Governor-General.The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands; Australian Antarctic Territory; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Coral Sea Islands; Heard Island and McDonald Islands; and Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales. The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen. In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council. Macquarie Island is administered by Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island by New South Wales.", "Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2011), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2013)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Since Summit is in Pima County, we look at the information related to city council terms. The relevant information indicates that council members serve four-year terms with no term limits. Therefore, city council terms in the city in the same county as Summit are four years long.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The religious data on India Census 2011 was released by the Government of India on 25 August 2015. Hindus are 79.8% (966.3 million), while Muslims are 14.23% (172.2 million) in India. and Christians are 2.30% (28.7 million). According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India. For the first time, a ``No religion ''category was added in the 2011 census. 2.87 million were classified as people belonging to`` No Religion'' in India in the 2011 census 0.24% of India's population of 1.21 billion. Given below is the decade - by - decade religious composition of India until the 2011 census. There are six religions in India that have been awarded ``National Minority ''status - Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis. Sunnis, Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and Ahmadiyyas were identified as sects of Islam in India. As per 2011 census, six major faiths - Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains make up over 99.4% of India's 1.21 billion population, while`` other religions, persuasions'' (ORP) count is 8.2 million. Among the ORP faiths, six faiths - 4.957 million - strong Sarnaism, 1.026 million - strong Gond, 506,000 - strong Sari, Donyi - Polo (302,000) in Arunachal Pradesh, Sanamahism (222,000) in Manipur, Khasi (138,000) in Meghalaya dominate. Maharashtra is having the highest number of atheists in the country with 9,652 such people, followed by Kerala.", "The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduvān (Hindus) and hindavī was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question refers to a word associated with the majority religion that became prominent in India following the partition of British India. This religion is known as Hinduism, which is derived from a Persian geographical term used by Arabs to describe people living beyond the Indus River. The Arabic equivalent for the term related to India is "Al-Hind," which refers to the country itself. Therefore, the religious context linked with the term in the Arabic dictionary is associated directly with Hinduism. 

Direct answer: Hinduism

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Gmina Jordanów is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Sucha County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland. Its seat is the town of Jordanów, although the town is not part of the territory of the gmina.', 'Gmina Brzeziny is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Brzeziny County, Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland. Its seat is the town of Brzeziny, although the town is not part of the territory of the gmina.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Gmina Jordanów is located in Sucha County. Therefore, we need to identify if there are any towns or cities situated within the same county - Sucha County. The relevant information indicates that the seat of Gmina Jordanów is the town of Jordanów, but it is noted that the town is not part of the territory of the gmina itself. However, since it resides in Sucha County, the town of Jordanów is indeed the city that is in the same county as Gmina Jordanów, even if it's not part of the gmina. 

Direct answer: Jordanów

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Humans have two lungs, a right lung and a left lung. They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the microscopic alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and lobules. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.', "Theologus Autodidactus, written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), is the first example of a science fiction novel. It deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection, and the afterlife. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology, astronomy, cosmology and geology known in his time. Ibn al-Nafis' fiction explained Islamic religious teachings via science and Islamic philosophy."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The scholar who theorized about pulmonary circulation is Ibn al-Nafis. Based on my knowledge, he lived from 1213 to 1288. To find his lifespan, I can calculate the difference between these two years. 1288 - 1213 equals 75 years.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The religious data on India Census 2011 was released by the Government of India on 25 August 2015. Hindus are 79.8% (966.3 million), while Muslims are 14.23% (172.2 million) in India. and Christians are 2.30% (28.7 million). According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India. For the first time, a ``No religion ''category was added in the 2011 census. 2.87 million were classified as people belonging to`` No Religion'' in India in the 2011 census 0.24% of India's population of 1.21 billion. Given below is the decade - by - decade religious composition of India until the 2011 census. There are six religions in India that have been awarded ``National Minority ''status - Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis. Sunnis, Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and Ahmadiyyas were identified as sects of Islam in India. As per 2011 census, six major faiths - Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains make up over 99.4% of India's 1.21 billion population, while`` other religions, persuasions'' (ORP) count is 8.2 million. Among the ORP faiths, six faiths - 4.957 million - strong Sarnaism, 1.026 million - strong Gond, 506,000 - strong Sari, Donyi - Polo (302,000) in Arunachal Pradesh, Sanamahism (222,000) in Manipur, Khasi (138,000) in Meghalaya dominate. Maharashtra is having the highest number of atheists in the country with 9,652 such people, followed by Kerala.", "The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduvān (Hindus) and hindavī was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The majority religion in the area that became India from British India is Hinduism. The Arabic equivalent for the term "India" is "Al-Hind," which referred to the country of India. However, the specific meaning of "Hindu" in Arabic is not directly provided in the available information. Based on the context surrounding these words, one can infer that "Hindu" would relate to the people or culture associated with India, but without a specific Arabic term for "Hindu" defined in the provided texts, I cannot provide a direct meaning from the Arabic dictionary.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: the country of India

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The break - up of the centralised Mughal empire by 1750, led to the creation of numerous semi-independent kingdoms (all provinces of the former Mughal empire). Nawab Siraj ud - Daulah was defeated by the British forces of Sir Robert Clive in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Thereafter the Nawab of Bengal became a ``puppet ruler ''depending on military support from British East India company to secure their throne. Siraj - ud - Daulah was replaced by Mir Jaffer. He was personally led to the throne by Robert Clive, after triumph of the British in the battle. He briefly tried to re-assert his power by allying with the Dutch, but this plan was ended by the Battle of Chinsurah. After the defeat at Battle of Buxar and grant of the Diwani (revenue collection) of Bengal by the then Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, to the British East India Company in August 1765 and the appointment of Warren Hastings by the East India Company as their first Governor General of Bengal in 1773, the Nawabs authority became restricted. By 1773, British East India company asserted much authority and formed the Bengal Presidency over areas ruled by the Nawabs i.e. the Bengal subah, along with some other regions and abolished the system of Dual Government. In 1793 (during Nawab Mubarak ud - Daulah's reign), the Nizamat (military power, civil and criminal justice) was abolished, British East India company thus annexed this former Mughal province as part of their empire and took complete control of the region, and the Nawabs of Bengal became mere pensioners of the British East India Company. All the Diwan offices except the Diwan Ton were also abolished.", "At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The dual system of government in Bengal was abolished by the British East India Company after it asserted significant authority following key battles and the grant of Diwani in 1765. The British East India Company was chartered in 1600.

The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the ``Long Nine ''for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).", 'Some time between the years 102 and 107, between the first and second Dacian wars, Trajan divided the province into Pannonia Superior (western part with the capital Carnuntum), and Pannonia Inferior (eastern part with the capitals in Aquincum and Sirmium). According to Ptolemy, these divisions were separated by a line drawn from Arrabona in the north to Servitium in the south; later, the boundary was placed further east. The whole country was sometimes called the Pannonias (Pannoniae).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Superior Drill Company is located in Springfield. Springfield became the capital of Illinois in 1839. I need to determine where the screenwriter of The Poor Boob, Z. Wall Covington, was born. However, I do not possess direct information regarding his birth location, and it is not explicitly stated in the knowledge provided. Despite knowing he's the screenwriter for The Poor Boob, without the birthplace, I cannot conclude the answer accurately. Therefore, I might have to consider the answer as Unknown since I can't verify Covington’s birthplace.

Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The flow of cold, gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake. The cold water flows near the surface and at first doesn\'t mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake. But then, at the so-called Rheinbrech, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen. Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne ("Rhine Gutter") and Seerhein. Depending on the water level, this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.', 'Silver Lake is a water body located in Carroll County in eastern New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Madison. The village of Silver Lake within Madison lies at the north end of the lake. Water from Silver Lake flows via the West Branch, through the Ossipee Pine Barrens to Ossipee Lake and ultimately to the Saco River in Maine.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The "juicy lucy" refers to a type of cheeseburger associated with Minneapolis. Since Minneapolis is located on the banks of the Mississippi River, I can determine the flow direction of the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River flows southward as it moves through Minneapolis.
