-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a red onion and a cookbook on the floor.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a knife, a cookbook and a sliced fried green hot pepper on the floor.

Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a knife, a cookbook and a sliced fried green hot pepper on the floor.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a red onion, a knife and a cookbook on the floor.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 1
Observation:

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

You've entered a supermarket.

You see a showcase. The showcase is metallic. On the showcase you can make out a raw red tuna, a block of cheese, a red apple and a raw white tuna. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open commercial glass door leading east.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Street =-
You are in a street. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an open commercial glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

You've just sauntered into a driveway.



There is an open front door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary one.

You can make out a sofa. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open front door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Livingroom =-5/73


Navigation step: 4
Observation: 

-= Corridor =-
You've entered a corridor.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Corridor =-5/74


Navigation step: 5
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You can make out a sofa. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is a closed front door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You've entered a corridor.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cookbook on the floor.
