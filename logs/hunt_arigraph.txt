-= Room A =-
You find yourself in a Room A. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a Golden locker.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a Key 1 on the floor.

 
 Your task is to get a treasure. Treasure is hidden in the golden locker. You need a golden key to unlock it. The key is hidden in one of the other lockers located in the environment. All lockers are locked and require a specific key to unlock. The key 1 you found in room A unlocks white locker. Read the notes that you find, they will guide you further.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a White locker. Now why would someone leave that there?

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Here we are in the Room D. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a Yellow locker.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a White locker. Now why would someone leave that there? The White locker contains a Note 2.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Observation: 

-= Room D =-
Here we are in the Room D. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a Yellow locker.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Observation: 

-= Room G =-
You arrive in a Room G. A standard kind of place.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a White locker. Now why would someone leave that there? The White locker contains a Key 1.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Room I =-
You've just shown up in a Room I.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a Brown locker. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a Room A. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a Golden locker.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a Key 1 on the floor.

 
 Your task is to get a treasure. Treasure is hidden in the golden locker. You need a golden key to unlock it. The key is hidden in one of the other lockers located in the environment. All lockers are locked and require a specific key to unlock. The key 1 you found in room A unlocks white locker. Read the notes that you find, they will guide you further.

Here we are in the Room D. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a Yellow locker.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a White locker. Now why would someone leave that there? The White locker is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You've just shown up in a Room I.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a Brown locker. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You make out a Blue locker.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Episodic memory: ["\nGame step #1\n$ \n\n\n\n-= Room A =-\nYou find yourself in a Room A. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a Golden locker.\n\nYou don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.\n\nThere is a Key 1 on the floor.\n\n \n Your task is to get a treasure. Treasure is hidden in the golden locker. You need a golden key to unlock it. The key is hidden in one of the other lockers located in the environment. All lockers are locked and require a specific key to unlock. The key 1 you found in room A unlocks white locker. Read the notes that you find, they will guide you further."]
