-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a toothbrush, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out a closed dishwasher here. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a dirty plate, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. On the king size bed you can make out a wet towel. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a business suit on the floor.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a dirty plate, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out a sleeping lamp, an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fantasy book on the floor.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks, a felt tip pens and a dumbbell. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. On the kids bed you can make out a toy car.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a dumbbell on the floor.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a dumbbell on the floor.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a toy car on the floor.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a fantasy book on the floor.

You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Gym =-
You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a toy car on the floor.

Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a toy car on the floor.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a toothbrush, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You've entered a Living Room. You can barely contain your excitement.

You make out a TV table. On the TV table you make out a TV. You shudder, but continue examining the room. What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is ordinary. On the sofa you can make out a raw meat and a decorative pillow. You scan the room, seeing a game consol cabinet. On the game consol cabinet you make out a gaming consol.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out a closed dishwasher here. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a dirty plate on the floor.

You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Living Room =-
You've entered a Living Room. You can barely contain your excitement.

You make out a TV table. On the TV table you make out a TV. You shudder, but continue examining the room. What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is ordinary. On the sofa you can make out a raw meat and a decorative pillow. You scan the room, seeing a game consol cabinet. On the game consol cabinet you make out a gaming consol.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. On the king size bed you can make out a wet towel. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a sleeping lamp on the floor.

On the sofa you can make out a decorative pillow. You scan the room, seeing a game consol cabinet. On the game consol cabinet you make out a gaming consol.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a sleeping lamp on the floor.

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out a sleeping lamp, an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out a sleeping lamp, an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kids Room =-
You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kids Room =-
You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fantasy book on the floor.

-= Gym =-
You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fantasy book on the floor.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an opened refrigerator in the corner. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an opened refrigerator in the corner. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

-= Kids Room =-
You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks, a felt tip pens and a dumbbell. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a toy car on the floor.

-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a dirty plate, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a wet towel and a toothbrush on the floor.

You've entered a Kids Room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toy storage cabinet. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy car and a toy sword. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a study table. The study table is typical. On the study table you make out a school notebooks, a felt tip pens and a dumbbell. You can make out a kids bed. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You find yourself in a Bathroom. A typical one.

You scan the room for a toilet, and you find a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you make out a toilet paper. You see a bathroom sink. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a toothbrush and a deodorant on the bathroom sink. Hey, want to see a towel rack? Look over there, a towel rack. You shudder, but continue examining the towel rack. On the towel rack you make out a wet towel.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out a closed dishwasher here. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out a sleeping lamp, an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out an elegant table runner, a dirty plate, a centerpiece and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Gym =-
You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a candles on the floor.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. What a letdown! The dishwasher is empty! You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a candles on the floor.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a Kitchen.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You can see a cook table! The cook table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a business suit on the floor.

You've entered a Gym.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You can make out an opened dishwasher here. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate.

You can see a cook table! On the cook table you can make out a candles.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You see a sport equipment locker. You make out a dumbbell stand. The dumbbell stand is usual. On the dumbbell stand you can see a dumbbell. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a treadmill. The treadmill appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
