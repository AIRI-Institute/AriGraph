-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a shed. An ordinary kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a workbench. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an open wooden door leading west.

You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n\n\n"]
