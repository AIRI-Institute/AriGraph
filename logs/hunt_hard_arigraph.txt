You've entered a Room D. Let's see what's in here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a Yellow locker. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've just walked into a Room C.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a Red locker.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
