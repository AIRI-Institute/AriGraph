There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Room H. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a Orange locker. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Room H =-
You find yourself in a Room H. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a Orange locker. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room H =-3/110


Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Room G =-
You've just shown up in a Room G.

You make out a White locker.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room G =-3/111

You've entered a Room D. Let's see what's in here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a Yellow locker. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room D =-3/112

Oh, great. Here's a Orange locker. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You make out a White locker.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a Yellow locker. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Room H. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a Orange locker. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room H =-3/76


Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Room G =-
You've just shown up in a Room G.

You make out a White locker.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room G =-3/77

You've entered a Room D. Let's see what's in here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a Yellow locker. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room D =-3/78


Navigation step: 4
Observation: 

-= Room C =-
You've just walked into a Room C.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a Red locker. The Red locker contains a Note 3.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Room C =-3/79
