-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Street =-
You're now in the street. The room is well lit.



There is an open commercial glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Driveway =-
You arrive in a driveway. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open front door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Driveway =-3/19


Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open front door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.



>                                                                                                                                -= Livingroom =-3/20


Navigation step: 4
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-3/21

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Observation:

I am stoked to announce that you are now in the backyard.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty. What's that over there? It looks like it's a patio chair. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well You can make out a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation: 

-= Street =-
You're now in the street. The room is well lit.



There is an open commercial glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Driveway =-
You arrive in a driveway. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open front door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Driveway =-4/30

Observation: 

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open front door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Navigation step: 4
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Game step #2


-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Backyard =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the backyard.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty. What's that over there? It looks like it's a patio chair. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well You can make out a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-3/19

You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open front door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

NAVIGATION


Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Street =-
You're now in the street. The room is well lit.



There is an open commercial glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Street =-4/27


Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Driveway =-
You arrive in a driveway. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open front door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Driveway =-4/28


Navigation step: 3
Observation: 

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open front door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.



>                                                                                                                                -= Livingroom =-4/29


Navigation step: 4
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a raw pork chop and a green hot pepper. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-4/30
