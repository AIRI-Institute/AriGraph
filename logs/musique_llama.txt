EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Jack Cohen (March 21, 1919, Brooklyn – April 16, 2012, Jerusalem) was an American Reconstructionist rabbi, educator, philosopher and author. Cohen held a PhD from Columbia University in the philosophy of education. In 1943 he was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) and, soon after, started to teach courses there. Cohen was one of the distinguished students of Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Movement, and was one of the founders of Kehillat Mevakshei Derech, a synagogue in Israel. Rabbi Dr. Jack Cohen was Honorary Chairman at Kaplan Center for Jewish Peoplehood and director of the Hillel Foundation at the Hebrew University for 23 years.', 'Derech Mitzvosecha, also titled Sefer Hamitzvos (), is an interpretive work on the Jewish commandments authored by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789–1866), the third Rebbe of the Chabad Hasidic movement. The work is considered a fundamental text of Chabad philosophy.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Derech Mitzvosecha is an interpretive work on the Jewish commandments authored by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, who is the third Rebbe of the Chabad Hasidic movement. Rabbi Dovber Schneuri is the second Rebbe, and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn's daughter is Chaya Mushka Schneersohn, who is the wife of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn. Therefore, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn followed Rabbi Dovber Schneuri.

Direct answer: Rabbi Dovber Schneuri
TRUE ANSWER: Dovber Schneuri

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Boston Celtics center Bill Russell holds the record for the most NBA championships won with 11 titles during his 13 - year playing career. He won his first championship with the Boston Celtics in his rookie year. Afterwards, he went on to win 10 championships in the next 12 years, including eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. He won the last two championships in 1968 and 1969 as player - coach. Russell's teammate, Sam Jones, won 10 championships from 1959 to 1969, the second most in NBA history. Four Celtics players, Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Satch Sanders and John Havlicek, won eight championships each. Two other Celtics, Jim Loscutoff and Frank Ramsey, won seven championships each. Four players, Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul - Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, won six championships each. Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s. George Mikan won 2 championships in the NBL before it merged with the BAA to form the NBA, and won 5 championships in the NBA.", "The NBA draft is an annual event dating back to 1947 in which the (now thirty) teams from the National Basketball Association (NBA) can draft players who are eligible and wish to join the league. These are typically college basketball players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. College players who have finished their four - year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 22 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called ``early - entrants ''or`` early - entry candidates''. The draft usually takes place at the end of June, during the NBA offseason. Since 1989, the draft has consisted of two rounds; this is much shorter than the entry drafts of the other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, all of which run at least seven rounds. Sixty players are selected in each draft. No player may sign with the NBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on AC charts, even after the songs have fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for RCA Music Group, said, "We\'ve seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits had become established. An article on MTV\'s website by Corey Moss describes this trend: "In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death. Or, to optimists, to get a second life."', 'AC radio stations may play mainstream music, but they will exclude hip hop, dance tracks, hard rock, and some forms of teen pop, as they are less popular amongst the target demographic of these radio stations, which is intended for an adult audience. AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years is that many adult contemporary stations play less newer music because they also give ample airtime to hits of the past, so the de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a notable pop artist who started their career on adult contemporary radio, similar to the performer of the album "Closer". Josh Groban is the performer of the album "Closer". Michael Bublé is mentioned as an artist who started as an AC artist. Clay Aiken, Kelly Clarkson, and John Mayer are also mentioned as artists who became successful with a ballad-heavy sound, which is often associated with adult contemporary music. 

Direct answer: Michael Bublé

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about a cast member of Escape from L.A. playing a character in another movie. From the relevant facts, I know that Kurt Russell stars in Escape from L.A. and is also the stepfather of Kate Hudson. Kate Hudson plays the wife of Mike Williams in another movie. Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams in that movie. Therefore, Kate Hudson played a character in a movie with Mark Wahlberg.

Direct answer: Mark Wahlberg

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.", 'Interracial relationships have had a long history in North America and the United States, beginning with the intermixing of European explorers and soldiers, who took native women as companions. After European settlement increased, traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes. In the 17th century, faced with a continuing, critical labor shortage, colonists primarily in the Chesapeake Bay Colony, imported Africans as laborers, sometimes as indentured servants and, increasingly, as slaves. African slaves were also imported into New York and other northern ports by the Dutch and later English. Some African slaves were freed by their masters during these early years.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the people who first imported slaves to New York and when they came to the country where Lord of the Rings was filmed. From the relevant texts, I know that the Dutch and later English imported African slaves into New York. The Lord of the Rings was filmed in New Zealand. Therefore, I need to find when the Dutch or English came to New Zealand.

From the relevant facts, I know that New Zealand was settled by the British. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the British Crown and the Māori in 1840. This is the earliest mention of the British coming to New Zealand.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Barton Premium is a Kentucky Blended whiskey produced in Bardstown, Kentucky by the Sazerac Company at its Barton 1792 Distillery. It is sold in glass in 16 oz pint bottles, glass 750ml bottles, glass 1-liter bottles and plastic 1.75L bottles.', 'Ten High is a brand of American whiskey first introduced in the 1930s by Hiram Walker & Sons, now produced by the Barton Brands division of the Sazerac Company. The name "Ten High" refers to a barrel storage location at least ten ricks high, as barrels in the upper part of the aging warehouse mature faster. Although the brand name evoked this storage method, the manufacturer did not actually promise that the brand was from barrels aged in such locations.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The headquarters of Barton Premium Blend's manufacturer is the Sazerac Company, which produces Barton Premium at its Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky. However, the question asks about the city where the headquarters is located, not the distillery. Since the headquarters of Sazerac Company is not explicitly mentioned, we need to find another connection. Barton Brands is a division of the Sazerac Company, and it produces Ten High, which was introduced by Hiram Walker & Sons. There is no direct connection to the headquarters of Sazerac Company, but we can try to find a connection to Detroit, where Dunbar Hospital is located, which is mentioned in several facts. Coleman Young was the first black mayor of Detroit, elected in 1973.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['New Haven was the location of one of Jim Morrison\'s infamous arrests while he fronted the rock group The Doors. The near-riotous concert and arrest in 1967 at the New Haven Arena was commemorated by Morrison in the lyrics to "Peace Frog" which include the line "...blood in the streets in the town of New Haven..." This was the first time a rock star had ever been arrested in concert.[citation needed] This event is portrayed in the movie The Doors (1991), starring Val Kilmer as Morrison, with a concert hall in Los Angeles used to depict the New Haven Arena.', 'Described as being "sexy, seductive and provocative" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego "Sasha Fierce" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being "too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy", stating, "I\'m not like her in real life at all." Sasha was conceived during the making of "Crazy in Love", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce. However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a movie based on an artist whose concert was the first Beyonce attended. From the relevant texts, we know that the first concert Beyonce attended was a Teena Marie concert. Now, we need to find a movie based on Teena Marie. However, there is no information about a movie based on Teena Marie. But, we have information about a song "Is She Really Going Out With Him" by Joe Jackson. We need to find a movie based on Joe Jackson. From the relevant facts, we know that "Look Sharp!" is the debut album of Joe Jackson, and "Is She Really Going Out With Him?" is a single from that album. Now, we need to find a movie based on Joe Jackson's life or music. Unfortunately, there is no information about a movie based on Joe Jackson's life or music.

He was survived by his wife, Thapuying Tawika Sarasin, and three sons, including Thai television host, Kanit Sarasin.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Pao Sarasin's birthplace is Thailand. During World War II, Thailand was not at war with the US. However, Japan had military aggression and occupied several countries, including the Netherlands. The US supplied Britain, China, and the Soviet Union during the war. The Northern Mariana Islands, which were inhabited by Chamorros, became a Japanese protectorate. Guam's Chamorros believed that the Northern Mariana Chamorros should be compassionate.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.', 'Founded in 1880 by Mathias Hatz, the company began to build engines in 1904. In 1910, Hatz began to produce hot bulb engines for stationary use. Based on that engine, the first Hatz water-cooled diesel engine, the H-series, was developed (max. power: 6\xa0kW; engine speed: 500 rpm; weight: 430\xa0kg). Three years later, a new plant was built at the present location and Hatz started to export engines to South America. In 1936, a two stroke engine with horizontal cylinder layout, the L2, which was especially intended for the use by the construction industry (max. power: 8\xa0kW; engine speed: 1100 rpm; weight: 360\xa0kg) was developed.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The English Church was brought back under papal authority in 1553 and doctrinal and liturgical conformity at the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary I. The restoration of papal authority was celebrated by the majority of the nation and enforced by the Marian persecutions against Protestants. Her harshness was a success but at the cost of alienating a fairly large section of English society which had been moving away from some traditional Catholic devotional practices. The English it seems were quite caught up with the reforming movement on the Continent. At the time they were neither Calvinist nor Lutheran, but certainly leaning toward Protestantism (and by the late 16th century, were certainly Protestant).', 'Upon his election to the papacy, Montini took the pontifical name Paul VI (the first to take the name "Paul" since 1605) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of Christ, following the example of Apostle St. Paul.[citation needed] He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, which was automatically closed with the death of John XXIII, and gave it priority and direction. After the council had concluded its work, Paul VI took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates, often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within Catholicism. The magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of Church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors. Paul VI was a Marian devotee, speaking repeatedly to Marian congresses and mariological meetings, visiting Marian shrines and issuing three Marian encyclicals. Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Egidio Vagnozzi is an Italian cardinal. The question is asking about someone who wanted to reform and address the institution behind the religion of Egidio Vagnozzi, which is Catholicism. This person is likely a Protestant reformer. Jonathan Edwards is a Puritan, but he is not known for addressing the institution behind Catholicism. John Wycliffe, Peter Waldo, and Martin Luther are known for attempting to reform the Catholic Church. Martin Luther is a good fit, as he started the Reformation and preached sermons.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.", 'Yuri Georgiyevich Bogatyryov (; 2 March 1947, Riga, Latvian SSR — 2 February 1989, Moscow, USSR) was a Soviet actor, best known for his roles in five films by Nikita Mikhalkov, including "At Home Among Strangers" (1974). Bogatyryov, one of the leading actors of Sovremennik (1971-1977) and then Moscow Art Theater (1977-1989), was designated People\'s Artist of Russia in 1988.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the arguer who claimed that Yuri Bogatyryov's country of citizenship (Soviet Union) had become an imperialist power and where they declared they would intervene in the Korean conflict. From the relevant texts, we know that the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan in August 1945 and later supported North Korean forces in the Korean conflict.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['However, the 18th century saw the European empires gradually expand across the world, as European states developed economies built on maritime trade. The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state to state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in nearby India and on the islands that are now Indonesia. The Qing response, successful for a time, was in 1756 to establish the Canton System, which restricted maritime trade to that city and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their governments.', 'The U.S. Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, following the House which passed a bill in December 2009. These bills must now be reconciled. The New York Times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the Obama administration. For instance, the Volcker Rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation, though in the Senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking when the party that controls the House of Representatives took control of the branch that gives regulators discretion to prohibit proprietary trades. From the relevant texts, I know that the Senate bill gives regulators discretion to prohibit proprietary trades. I also know that the Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives. From the relevant facts, I know that the 114th Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Hokkien degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education. Taiwan also has its own Hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in Hokkien on a regular basis.', 'Hokkien dialects are analytic; in a sentence, the arrangement of words is important to its meaning. A basic sentence follows the subject–verb–object pattern (i.e. a subject is followed by a verb then by an object), though this order is often violated because Hokkien dialects are topic-prominent. Unlike synthetic languages, seldom do words indicate time, gender and plural by inflection. Instead, these concepts are expressed through adverbs, aspect markers, and grammatical particles, or are deduced from the context. Different particles are added to a sentence to further specify its status or intonation.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: 
The question is asking about the country on the natural boundary between the country that hosted the tournament and the country where A Don is from. 
From the facts, we know that Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and A Don is near Vietnam. 
So, the country on the natural boundary between Russia and Vietnam is Myanmar. 
Now, we need to find out who brought the language Hokkien to Myanmar. 
From the facts, we know that Hokkien speakers form the largest group in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but there is no information about Myanmar. 
However, we know that Hokkien dialects are spoken in Southeast Asia, and Myanmar is a part of Southeast Asia. 
But, there is no specific information about who brought Hokkien to Myanmar.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.", 'A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated "Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry", as both groups – the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews – shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen. Atzmon\'s team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and the city's second largest ethnic group. From the given texts, we know that Ashkenazi Jews have a clear genetic signature and are a homogeneous genetic subgroup. We also know that they share large swaths of DNA with other Jewish groups and are more closely related to them than to non-Jewish groups. Additionally, the study found that Ashkenazi Jews are genetically similar to Italians, which may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire.

Direct answer: Italians and Irish
TRUE ANSWER: inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Partition of India was the division of British India in 1947 which accompanied the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan. The Dominion of India is today the Republic of India, and the Dominion of Pakistan is today the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of three provinces, Assam, Bengal and the Punjab, based on district - wide Hindu or Muslim majorities. The boundary demarcating India and Pakistan became known as the Radcliffe Line. It also involved the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury, between the two new dominions. The partition was set forth in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, as the British government there was called. The two self - governing countries of Pakistan and India legally came into existence at midnight on 14 -- 15 August 1947.", 'Classical India refers to the period when much of the Indian subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE). This period has been called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Russia was announced as the hosts on 2 December 2010 after the country was awarded the hosting rights of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played in four different stadiums across four cities: Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, and Sochi. It was the first time Russia has hosted the tournament, and the third time the Confederations Cup has been held in the European continent. As hosts, Russia qualified automatically for the tournament; they were joined by the six winners of the FIFA confederation championships and the 2014 FIFA World Cup champions, Germany.', 'The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions the country that hosted the tournament, which is Russia (from the text "Russia was announced as the hosts on 2 December 2010..."). It also mentions the country where A Don is located, which is Myanmar (from the fact "don, located in, sekong province" and "myanmar, also known as, burma"). The natural boundary between Russia and Myanmar does not exist, as they do not share a border. However, Myanmar shares a border with Thailand (from the fact "myanmar, borders, thailand"). The Yaruba dynasty, which ruled Oman, defeated the Portuguese (from the text "The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613..."). 

Direct answer: In 1613
TRUE ANSWER: The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Other states with long histories of no death penalty include Wisconsin (the only state with only one execution), Rhode Island (although later reintroduced, it was unused and abolished again), Maine, North Dakota, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Vermont. The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty; it was last used in 1957. Oregon abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings.', "Coles Creek (also known as Cole's Creek) is a tributary of Fishing Creek, in Columbia County, Pennsylvania and Sullivan County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is long and is the first named tributary of Fishing Creek downstream of where East Branch Fishing Creek and West Branch Fishing Creek meet to form Fishing Creek. The creek is on the edge of Columbia County and parts of its watershed are in Luzerne County."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Coles Creek is located in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is a state. Oregon reinstated the death penalty in 1984. But Oregon is not Pennsylvania. So, I need to find the information about Pennsylvania. There is no information about Pennsylvania reinstating the death penalty.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The government, consisting of the monarch and the ministers, will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause, thereafter notifying the States General that "The King assents to the proposal." It has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament. In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill, notifying the States General that "The King will keep the proposal under advisement." A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King\'s Offices.', 'Shakespeare\'s plays cannot be precisely dated, but it is generally agreed that these comedies followed a series of tragedies including "Othello", "King Lear" and "Macbeth". Shakespeare wrote tragedies because they were successful at the box office, but he returned to comedy towards the end of his career, mixing it with tragic and mystical elements. Shakespeare\'s late romances were also influenced by the development of tragicomedy and the extreme elaboration of the courtly masque as staged by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. The subjects and style of these plays were also influenced by the preference of the monarch, by Shakespeare\'s ageing company and by their more upper class audiences.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Bumping River is a tributary of the Naches River, in Washington in the United States. It flows down the east side of the Cascade Range, through Wenatchee National Forest and the William O. Douglas Wilderness. From its source at Fish Lake near Crag Mountain, it flows northeast to Bumping Lake, a natural lake enlarged and regulated by Bumping Lake Dam. Below the dam, the Bumping River continues flowing northeast. It is joined by the American River, its main tributary, a few miles above its mouth where it joins the Little Naches River to form the Naches River.', 'The settlement of Plympton, further up the River Plym than the current Plymouth, was also an early trading port, but the river silted up in the early 11th century and forced the mariners and merchants to settle at the current day Barbican near the river mouth. At the time this village was called Sutton, meaning south town in Old English. The name Plym Mouth, meaning "mouth of the River Plym" was first mentioned in a Pipe Roll of 1211. The name Plymouth first officially replaced Sutton in a charter of King Henry VI in 1440. See Plympton for the derivation of the name Plym.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the mouth of the river which serves as the mouth of the Bumping River. From the relevant texts, we know that the Bumping River is a tributary of the Naches River. Therefore, the mouth of the Bumping River is where it joins the Naches River. According to the text, it joins the Little Naches River to form the Naches River.

Direct answer: Naches River

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century, when it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat, a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given franchise. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.", "Albert Bedouce (8 January 1869, Toulouse – 4 August 1947) was a French politician. He joined at first the French Workers' Party (POF), which in 1902 merged into the Socialist Party of France (PSdF), which in turn merged into the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905. Bedouce was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1906 to 1919 and from 1924 to 1940. He was Minister of Public Works from 1936 to 1937. In the 1939 presidential election Bedouce was the candidate of the SFIO, but lost to Albert Lebrun, the candidate of the Democratic Republican Alliance. On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. For this he was expelled from the SFIO after the Liberation of France. In 1945 he joined, with his associate Émile Berlia, the newly founded Democratic Socialist Party (PSD)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I remember that Eugene V. Debs was a socialist candidate who ran for president. I also know that he received a double percentage of the popular votes in 1912. Therefore, I can conclude that the socialist candidate who ran for president in 1912 was part of the Socialist Party.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the longest win streak in the history of the league that includes the team with the most titles, from the event preceding the awarding of the MLB MVP. The team with the most titles is the New York Yankees, who have played in 40 World Series. The longest win streak in MLB history is 26 wins. However, this streak is not specific to the Yankees. The question is asking about the longest win streak that includes the Yankees, so we need to find the longest win streak achieved by the Yankees.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.", 'Scanderbeg (; RV 732) is an opera ("dramma per musica") in three acts composed by Antonio Vivaldi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Salvi. It was first performed at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence on 22 June 1718 to mark the re-opening of the theatre to public performances. While the libretto has been preserved, only fragments of the original score remain.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The composer of Scanderbeg is Antonio Vivaldi. The birth city of Antonio Vivaldi is Venice. The plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

By naturalisation By registration By adoption", 'Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes. No Democratic - held seats had fallen to the Republican Party in the 2006 elections. Democrat Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House. The House also received the first Muslim (Keith Ellison) and Buddhist (Hank Johnson and Mazie Hirono) members of Congress.', 'The Legislature is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House, led by a speaker, has 73 members apportioned among the 15 counties on the basis of the national census, with each county receiving a minimum of two members. Each House member represents an electoral district within a county as drawn by the National Elections Commission and is elected by a plurality of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term. The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators. Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected at-large by a plurality of the popular vote. The vice president serves as the President of the Senate, with a President pro tempore serving in their absence.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking when the majority party in the House of Representatives took control of the determiner of rules of the US House and US Senate. According to the relevant texts, the determiner of rules is mentioned in Section 5, which states that each house may determine the rules of its proceedings. This implies that the majority party in each house has control over the determiner of rules. The relevant text also mentions that the Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995, and Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["André S. Dreiding (22 June 1919 in Zürich – 24 December 2013 in Herrliberg near Zurich) was a Swiss chemist. He finished his high school studies in Zürich and then studied at Columbia University in New York where he was awarded BS and MS degrees. After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952. In 1954, Dreiding turned to Switzerland and University of Zurich, where he became professor, and stayed until his retirement in 1987, after which he has been emeritus professor.", 'Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.']

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Jim Wilson was released by a team, but the relevant facts don't mention Jim Wilson. However, they do mention John Mayberry, who played for the Royals. Since the Royals are a team, it's possible that Jim Wilson was released by the Royals. If that's the case, we need to find out who has the most hits in the history of the organization that includes the Royals.

Direct answer: George Davis

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin\'s death, Joseph Stalin established \'socialism in one country\' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.', "In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the Americans. Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned that the Americans would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. At that time, the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5.6 million soldiers. However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border. Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 action spy film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum.  The screenplay was written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and based on a screen story of the novel by Gilroy.  The Bourne Ultimatum is the third in the Jason Bourne film series, being preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016.', 'The titular character Jason Bourne does not appear in The Bourne Legacy, because actor Matt Damon chose not to return for the fourth film, due to Paul Greengrass not directing. Bourne is shown in pictures and mentioned by name several times throughout the film. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of The Bourne Legacy take place at the same time as the previous film, The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the actor who plays the title character in The Bourne Betrayal. However, The Bourne Betrayal is a novel, not a film. Therefore, there is no actor who plays the title character in The Bourne Betrayal.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: Matt Damon

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Fifth Amendment (Amendment V) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights and protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. ``Pleading the Fifth ''is a colloquial term for invoking the right that allows witnesses to decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them, and generally without having to suffer a penalty for asserting the right. This evidentiary privilege ensures that defendants can not be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials. If, however, they choose to testify, they are not entitled to the right during cross-examination, where questions are relevant to their testimony on direct examination. The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a grand jury. Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question. To claim the privilege for failure to answer when being interviewed by police, the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions.", 'As of August 2015, Jehovah\'s Witnesses report an average of 8.2 million publishers—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 118,016 congregations. In 2015, these reports indicated over 1.93 billion hours spent in preaching and "Bible study" activity. Since the mid-1990s, the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5 million to 8.2 million. In the same year, they conducted "Bible studies" with over 9.7 million individuals, including those conducted by Witness parents with their children. Jehovah\'s Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1.5% per year.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is about the group that performed "From Them, Through Us, to You". I don't have any direct information about this group. However, I have information about other groups like Madina Lake, which is an American alternative rock band formed in Chicago in 2005. But I don't have any information about a group related to "From Them, Through Us, to You".

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Classical India refers to the period when much of the Indian subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE). This period has been called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.', "The Secretary of State for India or India Secretary was the British Cabinet minister and the political head of the India Office responsible for the governance of the British Raj (India), Aden, and Burma. The post was created in 1858 when the East India Company's rule in Bengal ended and India except for the Princely States was brought under the direct administration of the government in London, beginning the official colonial period under the British Empire."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the Arabic dictionary meaning of the word referring to the majority religion in the area of British India, which became India when the country containing Barawal was formed. From the relevant facts, I know that Barawal is an administrative unit in Pakistan, and Pakistan was formed from the majority Muslim areas of British India. Therefore, the majority religion in the area of British India that became India is Hinduism. The word "Hindu" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Sindhu", which refers to the river. In Arabic, the word "al-Hind" refers to the country of India.

A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.', 'A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.']

Bernini's overall fee was 7,000 Roman scudi.", 'The Basilica Cathedral of Lima, otherwise Lima Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in the Plaza Mayor of downtown Lima, Peru.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Confederate States Army (C.S.A.) was the military ground force of the Confederate States of America (Confederacy) during the American Civil War (1861 - 1865). On February 28, 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president, Jefferson Davis (1808 - 1889), a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican -- American War (1846 - 1848), later a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War in the administration of 14th President Franklin Pierce (1853 - 1857). By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.', "The Battle for Mexico City was the series of engagements from September 8 to September 15, 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the Mexican–American War. Included are major actions at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec, culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the Battle of Churubusco on August 8 where the Saint Patrick's Battalion, which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants, but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexican people, fought for the Mexican cause repelling the American attacks. After defeating the Saint Patrick's Battalion, the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States deployed combat units deep into Mexico resulting in the capture of Mexico City and Veracruz by the U.S. Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions. The invasion culminated with the storming of Chapultepec Castle in the city itself."]

Villanueva and Asian Women United of California); and "East to America: Korean-American Life Stories" (co-editor with Eui-Young Yu). Kim has also produced several videos about Asian American women.', "Women's political status without the vote was promoted by the National Council of Women of Canada from 1894 to 1918. It promoted a vision of ``transcendent citizenship ''for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public - spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation - building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race - based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from`` racial degeneration.''"]

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Ioannina National Airport is named after King Pyrrhus, so I need to find information about the war with King Pyrrhus. I found a relevant fact: "period, includes, war with pyrrhus". However, it does not specify the exact years of the war. I also found a relevant text: "Plutarch, wrote, life of pyrrhus", which suggests that Plutarch wrote about Pyrrhus' life, but it does not provide the exact years of the war either.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['According to the Primary Chronicle, the territories of the East Slavs in the 9th century were divided between the Varangians and the Khazars. The Varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. In 862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes in the area of Novgorod rebelled against the Varangians, driving them "back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves." The tribes had no laws, however, and soon began to make war with one another, prompting them to invite the Varangians back to rule them and bring peace to the region:', 'The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a "German" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the Saxons, Franci, Thuringii, Alamanni and Bavarii. These five tribes, sometimes with inclusion of the Frisians, are considered as the major groups to take part in the formation of the Germans. The varieties of the German language are still divided up into these groups. Linguists distinguish low Saxon, Franconian, Bavarian, Thuringian and Alemannic varieties in modern German. By the 9th century, the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern Germany had been united under the rule of the Frankish king Charlemagne, known in German as Karl der Große. Much of what is now Eastern Germany became Slavonic-speaking (Sorbs and Veleti), after these areas were vacated by Germanic tribes (Vandals, Lombards, Burgundians and Suebi amongst others) which had migrated into the former areas of the Roman Empire.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the version of the language where the last name Sylvester originates, used in the era of the king that united the tribes in the 9th century. The king that united the tribes in the 9th century is Charlemagne, a Frankish king. The Frankish tribe is one of the Germanic tribes that took part in the formation of the Germans. The varieties of the German language are divided into groups such as Franconian, Bavarian, Thuringian, and Alemannic. The Latin language changed from Classical Latin to Medieval Latin. The noun "silva" means "woodland" in Latin. Sylvester is likely derived from the Latin word "silva". Therefore, the version of the language where the last name Sylvester originates is Medieval Latin.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps.', 'Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Jimmy Carter was nominated for president at the Democratic National Convention in 1976, which was held at Madison Square Garden. Madison Square Garden is located in the New York metropolitan area. The New York Knicks play at Madison Square Garden. Therefore, the New York City team that does not host NBA games at the site where Jimmy Carter was nominated for president is the Brooklyn Nets.

Direct answer: Brooklyn Nets
TRUE ANSWER: Brooklyn Nets NBA

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"Turn Around (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)" is a song by American rapper Flo Rida from his third studio album, "Only One Flo (Part 1)". It was released as the second single on 8 November 2010 in the United States. The song contains samples of "Din Daa Daa" by German dance singer George Kranz, and "Oh Yeah" by Swiss electronica band Yello. It debuted at number 98 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and was featured prominently in the closing credits of "The Hangover Part II". It was the second such use of a Flo Rida song in the closing credits of a film from "The Hangover" franchise—the first was "Right Round", which also featured DJ Frank E and was used in the closing credits of "The Hangover".', 'Oh Yeah is a 1962 album by jazz musician Charles Mingus.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['BULLET::::- Cosmic Boy, along with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, made his live-action debut in the eleventh episode of the eighth season of the CW series "Smallville", portrayed by actor Ryan Kennedy. In the episode, Rokk is seen as the silent leader type. The most determined of the group, Rokk comes the closest to killing Chloe Sullivan, only to be stopped by Clark Kent, who informs Rokk that any Legion inspired by him should never resort to murder. When the group does defeat Brainiac by extracting him from Chloe - Rokk playing a crucial role as he magnetically extracts the particles of Brainiac from her body - Rokk changes the Legion rules accordingly. Just before he leaves, Rokk warns Clark of the days ahead, telling him to be careful. Though mainly referred to as Rokk, Lightning Lad calls him "Cos" at one point in the episode. He later returns in the season finale to give Clark a new Legion ring after his was destroyed in "Infamous" and warns him that nothing can stop Doomsday from killing him. He gives Clark the ring and tells him to send Doomsday to the future, as the Legion is prepared to fight him there.', 'Cosmo\'s Cosmic Adventure: Forbidden Planet is a video game programmed by Todd Replogle and published by Apogee Software. It is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game. Its working titles were "The Adventures of Zonk" and "Cosmo Kid from Space", but Stephen Hornback ultimately gave it the final name. The game was released in mid March 1992 on the DOS platform.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the creator of the work that features Cosmic Boy. From the memory, I found that Cosmic Boy made his live-action debut in the CW series "Smallville". However, "Smallville" is a TV series, not a comic book or a work that features Cosmic Boy's creation. The creators of Superman, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, are mentioned in the memory, but they are not related to Cosmic Boy's creation. Since I couldn't find any information about the creation of Cosmic Boy, I will answer "Unknown".

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["My Fair Lady is a musical based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The story concerns Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phoneticist, so that she may pass as a lady. The original Broadway, London and starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.", 'Dame Enid Diana Elizabeth Rigg, DBE (born 20 July 1938) is an English actress. She is known for playing Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers (1965 -- 68), and Olenna Tyrell in Game of Thrones (2013 -- 17). She has also had an extensive career in theatre, including playing the title role in Medea, both in London and New York, for which she won the 1994 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She was made a CBE in 1988 and a Dame in 1994 for services to drama.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the actress in My Fair Lady who won a Tony award. From the relevant texts, I know that Julie Andrews starred in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady. However, I don't have information about Julie Andrews winning a Tony award. But I do have information about Dame Enid Diana Elizabeth Rigg winning a Tony award for Best Actress in a Play for her role in Medea. Since the question is asking about the actress in My Fair Lady, I'm not sure if the answer is Julie Andrews or someone else.

From the given facts, I know that Oklahoma's US Senators are James Lankford and Tom Coburn, and they are both Republicans. The body determining the rules of the US House and US Senate is the Senate. From the text, I know that the 114th Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress of 1929-1931, and Republicans gained control of the Senate.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Supreme Court is the highest court in Ireland. It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional. It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law. Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law. The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government. The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.', "In the case of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the most significant abortion rights case before the Supreme Court since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, the Supreme Court in a 5 -- 3 decision on June 27, 2016, swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult - to - obtain ``admitting privileges ''at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital - grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions`` facially'' from the law at issue -- that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, but the relevant facts and texts do not provide specific information about the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. Therefore, I cannot determine the answer to this question.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Pan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the Napoleonic Wars. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the Romanovs and the Habsburgs. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the Reformation when the Holy Roman Empire was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of East Prussia, sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.", 'In 1870, after France attacked Prussia, Prussia and its new allies in Southern Germany (among them Bavaria) were victorious in the Franco-Prussian War. It created the German Empire in 1871 as a German nation-state, effectively excluding the multi-ethnic Austrian Habsburg monarchy and Liechtenstein. Integrating the Austrians nevertheless remained a strong desire for many people of Germany and Austria, especially among the liberals, the social democrats and also the Catholics who were a minority within the Protestant Germany.']

It also mentions the leader of the North German Confederation during the Franco-Prussian War, which is Prussia. Additionally, it mentions the Habsburg Monarchy.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Cyberdyne Systems Series T-800 / T-850 Model 101, or "The Terminator", is a fictional character from the "Terminator" franchise portrayed by both Arnold Schwarzenegger and numerous actor stand-ins digitally overlaid with Schwarzenegger\'s likeness. The Terminator itself is part of a series of machines created by Skynet for infiltration-based assassination missions, and while an android for its appearance resembling a human, it is described as a cybernetic organism consisting of living tissue over a robotic endoskeleton.', 'The Intolerable Acts was the term invented by 19th century historians to refer to a series of punitive laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 after the Boston Tea Party. The laws were meant to punish the Massachusetts colonists for their defiance in the Boston Tea Party protest in reaction to changes in taxation by the British to the detriment of colonial goods. In Great Britain, these laws were referred to as the Coercive Acts.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a law passed by an actor from Terminator. The actor from Terminator is Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, Arnold Schwarzenegger is an actor, not a legislative body, so he cannot pass laws. The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid's first team in response to an appeal made by then - Real Madrid coach José Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach. In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid's new sporting director. In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.", 'After the 2006 season, Cancela was taken by Toronto FC in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft, but dealt to the Colorado Rapids in April of the following year in exchange for a Youth International slot to be held by Toronto until 2009. He was waived by the Rapids before the 2008 season.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: From the relevant texts, I found that Jose Cancela was taken by Toronto FC in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft, and then dealt to the Colorado Rapids. This implies that Jose Cancela was a member of the Colorado Rapids team. The Colorado Rapids compete in Major League Soccer (MLS).

Direct answer: Major League Soccer

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.', 'Somali people in the Horn of Africa are divided among different countries (Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and northeastern Kenya) that were artificially and some might say arbitrarily partitioned by the former imperial powers. Pan-Somalism is an ideology that advocates the unification of all ethnic Somalis once part of Somali empires such as the Ajuran Empire, the Adal Sultanate, the Gobroon Dynasty and the Dervish State under one flag and one nation. The Siad Barre regime actively promoted Pan-Somalism, which eventually led to the Ogaden War between Somalia on one side, and Ethiopia, Cuba and the Soviet Union on the other.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the people who the Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire declared independence from, which is Portugal. The natural boundary between Thailand and the country where Nam Theun is found is the boundary between Thailand and Laos. The question is asking how the Portuguese were expelled from this boundary.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese

Each province of Pakistan are represented by fourteen senators and eight senators from the tribal areas regardless of population, who serve staggered six-year terms. The Senate secretariat is located in the east wing of the Parliament Building; the National Assembly convenes in the west wing of the same building."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions legislators elected for six-year terms, which reminds me of the text "Each province of Pakistan are represented by fourteen senators and eight senators from the tribal areas regardless of population, who serve staggered six-year terms." This suggests that the country in question is Pakistan. In Pakistan, the prime minister is referred to as the "Prime Minister of Pakistan".

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['When World War II started in 1939, it divided the world into two alliances—the Allies (the United Kingdom and France at first in Europe, China in Asia since 1937, followed in 1941 by the Soviet Union, the United States); and the Axis powers consisting of Germany, Italy and Japan.[nb 1] During World War II, the United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union controlled Allied policy and emerged as the "Big Three". The Republic of China and the Big Three were referred as a "trusteeship of the powerful"  and were recognized as the Allied "Big Four" in Declaration by United Nations in 1942. These four countries were referred as the "Four Policemen" of the Allies and considered as the primary victors of World War II. The importance of France was acknowledged by their inclusion, along with the other four, in the group of countries allotted permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.', 'China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are often referred to as great powers by academics due to "their political and economic dominance of the global arena". These five nations are the only states to have permanent seats with veto power on the UN Security Council. They are also the only recognized "Nuclear Weapons States" under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and maintain military expenditures which are among the largest in the world. However, there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to the current status of these powers or what precisely defines a great power. For example, sources have at times referred to China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom as middle powers.']

It was first formally adopted in 1890, with the formation of Italian Eritrea (Colonia Eritrea). The territory became the Eritrea Governorate within Italian East Africa in 1936. Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia in 1953 (nominally within a federation until 1962) and an Eritrean Liberation Front formed in 1960. Eritrea gained independence following the 1993 referendum, and the name of the new state was defined as State of Eritrea in the 1997 constitution.[citation needed]']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Chao Phraya Bodindecha (, , 1777–1849), personal name Sing Sinhaseni (), was one of the most prominent political and military figures of the early Bangkok Rattanakosin Kingdom. Bodindecha was both a top military general () and Chief Minister in charge of civilian affairs as the "Akkhra Maha Senabodi" () of the "Samuha Nayok" ) during the reign of King Rama III. He was known for putting down the Laotian Rebellion (1826–1828} (ปราบกบฎ) of Lord Anouvong of Vientiane (เจ้าอนุวงศ์ เวียงจันทน์) and for campaigns during the Siamese-Vietnamese Wars of 1831–1834 and 1841–1845.', 'South Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) on Orchid Island in Indian River County, Florida, United States. The population was 3,501 at the 2010 census. It is ranked tenth in Florida locations by per capita income as of 2010.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Chao Phraya Bodindecha died in 1849, and he was from the Bangkok Rattanakosin Kingdom. The Beach is a film, but there is no information about filming locations in Thailand or the Bangkok Rattanakosin Kingdom. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific location where they filmed The Beach in the country where Bodindecha died.

From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Darren Carter's team is not specified, but we know that Notts County won the FA Cup in 1894. We need to find out which team Darren Carter played for. From the memory, we know that Carter joined Preston North End, was loaned to Millwall, played for Forest Green Rovers, and joined Solihull Moors. We don't have any information about Darren Carter's team beating Notts County.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Fort Ruhya was a fort in Oude, India. It was the site of conflict during the Indian rebellion of 1857 where 4 soldiers of the British Army were awarded Victoria Crosses. Today, there is a cemetery where one of the recipients, Edward Spence, is interred.', "The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles northeast of Delhi (now Old Delhi). It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities formally to have ended until 8 July 1859."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the ruler that was dissolved after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. From the relevant facts, I know that the British East India Company's rule was transferred to the Crown after the rebellion. Therefore, the ruler that was dissolved is the British East India Company. To find when it was established, I can look up the relevant fact that says "British East India Company, established, 1599".

He is violent and self - important and was trained by the League of Assassins, learning to kill at a young age, which troubles the relationship with his father, who refuses to kill. However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny. After the events of Batman R.I.P. and Batman: Battle for the Cowl, he takes the role of Robin at ten years of age, becoming the fifth person to use the Robin persona.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives. The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, de facto leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party. Neither does the Speaker regularly participate in floor debates nor vote.", "The Elections for the United States House of Representatives on 5 November 2002 was in the middle of President George W. Bush's first term. Although it was a midterm election, the Republican Party gained a net eight seats, solidifying their majority. Together with gains made in the Senate, it was one of the few mid-term elections that the party in control of the White House increased their number of seats in the House (the other such mid-term elections were in 1934 and 1998)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the leaders of the opposition party in the House of Representatives in 2002. From the texts, I know that the Republican Party solidified their majority in the 2002 midterm election. This means the Democratic Party was the opposition party. The leader of the opposition party is the Minority Leader. From the facts, I know that Nancy Pelosi was the Minority Leader.

Direct answer: Nancy Pelosi
TRUE ANSWER: anti-slavery activists, modernizers, ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The Navigation Acts threatened trading practices in the New England region. The largest state in this region is Maine. However, the question asks for the population of the largest state, not Maine. Pennsylvania is the 6th most populous state and is also in the New England region. Therefore, the answer is the population of Pennsylvania.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software. The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free of charge." The earliest-known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition of the now-discontinued GNU\'s Bulletin publication of FSF. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. , it is published there in 39 languages. FSF publishes a list of licences which meet this definition.', 'In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix. The name GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU\'s Not Unix". Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts. Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['According to Chen, the Ming officer of Hezhou (modern day Linxia) informed the Hongwu Emperor that the general situation in Dbus and Gtsang "was under control," and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second Phagmodru ruler, Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen, an official title. According to the Records of the Founding Emperor, the Hongwu Emperor issued an edict granting the title "Initiation State Master" to Sagya Gyaincain, while the latter sent envoys to the Ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira.', 'On 12 February 1912, after rounds of negotiations, Longyu issued an imperial edict bringing about the abdication of the child emperor Puyi. This brought an end to over 2,000 years of Imperial China and began an extended period of instability of warlord factionalism. The unorganized political and economic systems combined with a widespread criticism of Chinese culture led to questioning and doubt about the future. In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo in 1932, with Puyi, as the emperor. After the invasion by the Soviet Union, Manchukuo collapsed in 1945.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The edict was addressed to the Karmapa, and the Yongle Emperor greeted Deshin Shekpa, who is the 5th Karmapa Lama. The Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa to Nanjing. Therefore, the city where the Yongle Emperor greeted the leader that the edict was addressed to is Nanjing. Nanjing has the Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company, but it is not an opera company. However, Nanjing also has the Nanjing Dance Company. Still, it is not an opera company. The answer is not among the given opera companies.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization, the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams play in the National League (NL) and American League (AL), with 15 teams in each league. The NL and AL operated as separate legal entities from 1876 and 1901 respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities since 1903, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball in 2000. The organization also oversees Minor League Baseball, which comprises about 240 teams affiliated with the Major League clubs. With the World Baseball Softball Confederation, MLB manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.', 'Willie Mays World Series MVP Award George Springer, 2017 World Series MVP Given for Annual Most Valuable Player of the World Series Country United States Presented by Major League Baseball History First award 1955 Most recent George Springer, 2017 Houston Astros']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.', 'Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Daihatsu Charmant is a subcompact sedan, and it's not related to Lexus RX 350. Daihatsu is a separate company, and its luxury division doesn't exist. Lexus is a luxury division of Toyota, and it produces the RX 350. The facelift of the RX 350 was introduced in 2012.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: Sales began worldwide in April 2012

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Mercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to sing in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. The lyrics, written by Mercer, are reminiscent of his childhood in Savannah, Georgia, including its waterways. As a child, he had picked huckleberries in summer, and connected them with a carefree childhood and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. Although an instrumental version is played over the film's opening titles, the lyrics are first heard in a scene where Paul ``Fred ''Varjak (George Peppard) discovers Holly Golightly (Hepburn) singing the song, and accompanying herself on the guitar, while sitting on the fire escape outside their apartments.", "In the original Broadway production, ``Some Enchanted Evening ''was sung by former Metropolitan Opera bass Ezio Pinza. Pinza won the Tony Award for Best Actor in 1950 for this role, and the song made him a favorite with audiences and listeners who normally did not attend or listen to opera. In the 2001 London revival of the show, Philip Quast won an Olivier Award for Best Actor for his role as Emile, and seven years later, international opera singer Paulo Szot won a Tony for his portrayal in the 2008 New York revival."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Mercer and Mancini wrote the song Moon River for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn received a special Tony Award.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Sir William Maule was the eldest son of Sir Peter Maule and Christina de Valognes, Baron and Baroness of Panmure and Benvie. William succeeded as Baron in 1254 on his father's death. He was married to Ethana de Vallibus, daughter of John Vaux, Lord of Dirleton, and left one son, Henry Maule, who succeeded him as Baron.", "John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was released from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoulême, left England for Angoulême soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons – Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip – and three daughters – Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1926, British wizard and ``magizoologist ''Newt Scamander arrives by ship to New York en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (`` No - Maj'' or ``Muggle '') who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. While Newt listens to her speech about how witches and wizards are real and dangerous, a`` Niffler'' -- a small platypus - like creature which hoards shiny objects -- escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase and slips into a nearby bank. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No - Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['True Grit is a 2010 American Revisionist Western film directed, written, produced, and edited by the Coen brothers and executively produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously released in 1969 starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell. This version stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Deputy U.S. Marshal Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.', "True Grit is a 1969 American western film. It is the first film adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name.

Wayne won his only Academy Award for his performance in this film and reprised his role for the 1975 sequel Rooster Cogburn."]

Along with the adjoining Lansdown Cemetery it is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.", 'William Beckford (baptised 19 December 1709 – 21 June 1770) was a well-known political figure in 18th-century London, who twice held the office of Lord Mayor of London (1762 and 1769). His vast wealth came largely from his plantations in Jamaica and the large numbers of slaves working on these plantations. He was, and is, often referred to as "Alderman Beckford" to distinguish him from his son William Thomas Beckford, the author and art collector.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: From the given texts, I found that William Beckford had a son named William Thomas Beckford, who was an author and art collector. However, there is no direct information about William Beckford's child dying. But, I found a sentence "The youngest child, had died, by 1742" which might be related to William Beckford's child. Unfortunately, there is no specific information about where the child died.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).', 'The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months -- a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March / early April to late September / early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 261⁄2 weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day. It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games in the League Championship Series / World Series).']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A referee may stop the match when they or official ring physician decides that a wrestler cannot safely continue the match. This may be decided if the wrestler cannot continue the match due to an injury. At the Great American Bash in 2008, Chris Jericho was declared the winner of a match against Shawn Michaels when Michaels could not defend himself due to excessive blood loss and impaired vision. At NXT TakeOver: Rival in 2015, the referee stopped the match when Sami Zayn could not defend himself due to an injury sustained against Kevin Owens for the NXT Championship.', "The 1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships. In the final, Björn Borg defeated John McEnroe 1 -- 6, 7 -- 5, 6 -- 3, 6 -- 7, 8 -- 6 to win the match. It was regarded at the time as the greatest match ever played. It would be another 28 years before the 2008 Wimbledon men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal would rival the match as the greatest ever played."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the wrestler who has held the intercontinental championship the most times and where they won in 2008. From the memory, I found that Dolph Ziggler retained the intercontinental championship, but it doesn't specify where. Then, I found that The Miz has the seventh reign, which implies that he has held the intercontinental championship the most times. Finally, I found that The Miz won the championship by defeating Dean Ambrose, but again, it doesn't specify where.

Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Tales of the Texas Rangers is a 20th century Western old-time radio and television police procedural drama which originally aired on NBC Radio from 1950 to 1952 and later on CBS Television from 1955 to 1958. Film star Joel McCrea voiced the radio version as the fictitious Texas Ranger Jace Pearson, who uses the latest scientific techniques to identify criminals. His faithful horse, Charcoal (or "Charky"), helps Pearson to track down the culprits. The radio shows, some of which are available on the Internet, are reenactments of actual Texas Ranger cases.', "However, the Texas Rangers were not formally constituted until 1835. Austin returned to Texas after having been imprisoned in Mexico City and helped organize a council to govern the group. On October 17, at a consultation of the Provisional Government of Texas, Daniel Parker proposed a resolution to establish the Texas Rangers. He proposed creating three companies that would total some 60 men and would be known by ``uniforms ''consisting of a light duster (clothing) and an identification badge made from a Mexican Peso.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"Underpass" is a song by UK artist John Foxx, and was released as a single in January 1980. It was the artist\'s first solo single release after leaving the band Ultravox and the first single release from the "Metamatic" album, which was released shortly after.', '"Big Girls Don\'t Cry" is a single by American country music artist Lynn Anderson. Released in July 1968, it was the first single from her album "Big Girls Don\'t Cry". The song peaked at number 12 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the "RPM" Country Tracks chart in Canada.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Beyonce's first solo album is "Dangerously in Love". The lead single from this album is "Crazy in Love", which features Jay-Z. The song "Cry" is not the lead single from this album. I don't have information about a song "Cry" from Beyonce's first solo album.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: three different relationships he had in the past

Upon his death, Michael, his youngest son, succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family.', "The Prime Minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen. It is also known as the cabinet. The cabinet carries out the country's domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress. If the Minority Leader's party takes control of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats, the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader. The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues.", 'The Connecticut State Senate is the upper house of the Connecticut General Assembly, the state legislature of the US state of Connecticut. The state senate comprises 36 members, each representing a district with around 99,280 inhabitants. Senators are elected to two-year terms without term limits. The Connecticut State Senate is one of 14 state legislative upper houses whose members serve two-year terms; four-year terms are more common.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking when the party holding the majority in the House of Representatives took control of the determiner of rules of the House and Senate. The determiner of rules of the House and Senate is likely referring to the Speaker of the House, who has discretionary power and presides over the House. However, the question does not provide a specific time frame or event to narrow down the answer.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The impeachment of Warren Hastings was a failed attempt between 1788 and 1795 to impeach the first Governor - General of India in the Parliament of Great Britain. Hastings was accused of misconduct during his time in Calcutta particularly relating to mismanagement and personal corruption. The prosecution was led by Edmund Burke and became a wider debate about the role of the East India Company and the expanding empire in India.', "Impeachment in the United States is an enumerated power of the legislature that allows formal charges to be brought against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed. Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office, though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes. The actual trial on such charges, and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction, is separate from the act of impeachment itself. Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and both were later acquitted by the Senate. The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed, as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment, but such a vote was widely expected to pass, and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon's departure. To date, no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction. The impeached official continues in office until conviction."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Ten High is a brand of American whiskey first introduced in the 1930s by Hiram Walker & Sons, now produced by the Barton Brands division of the Sazerac Company. The name "Ten High" refers to a barrel storage location at least ten ricks high, as barrels in the upper part of the aging warehouse mature faster. Although the brand name evoked this storage method, the manufacturer did not actually promise that the brand was from barrels aged in such locations.', 'High tech companies have located in the area since the 1930s, when International Radio Corporation introduced the first mass-produced AC/DC radio (the Kadette, in 1931) as well as the first pocket radio (the Kadette Jr., in 1933). The Argus camera company, originally a subsidiary of International Radio, manufactured cameras in Ann Arbor from 1936 to the 1960s. Current firms include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), JSTOR (the digital scholarly journal archive), MediaSpan (provider of software and online services for the media industries), Truven Health Analytics, and ProQuest, which includes UMI. Ann Arbor Terminals manufactured a video-display terminal called the Ann Arbor Ambassador during the 1980s. Barracuda Networks, which provides networking, security, and storage products based on network appliances and cloud services, opened an engineering office in Ann Arbor in 2008 on Depot St. and recently announced it will move downtown to occupy the building previously used as the Borders headquarters.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Power Rangers Turbo is an American television series created by Haim Saban and the fifth season of the Power Rangers franchise, began airing April 19, 1997 on Fox Kids. The series follows a group of teenagers chosen by the wise sage Zordon to become "Power Rangers" in order to stop evil from taking over the planet Earth. "Turbo" comprises 45 episodes and concluded its initial airing November 24, 1997. "Turbo" uses footage and elements from the Super Sentai series "Gekisou Sentai Carranger" and follows the annual Ranger suit change (started in "Zeo") to match the annual change of the Super Sentai series. Regular cast members during "Turbo" include Johnny Yong Bosch, Nakia Burrise, Blake Foster, Jason David Frank, Catherine Sutherland, Carol Hoyt, and Gregg Bullock. Part way through the season, Jason Narvy and Paul Schrier re-join the main cast, Bosch, Burrise, Frank, and Sutherland are replaced by Roger Velasco, Tracy Lynn Cruz, Selwyn Ward, and Patricia Ja Lee respectively. The four play new characters, but take on the previous characters\' respective colors and powers. Hoyt continues to play Dimitria, but is later replaced by Hilary Shepard Turner for the role of Divatox.', 'Tales of the Texas Rangers is a 20th century Western old-time radio and television police procedural drama which originally aired on NBC Radio from 1950 to 1952 and later on CBS Television from 1955 to 1958. Film star Joel McCrea voiced the radio version as the fictitious Texas Ranger Jace Pearson, who uses the latest scientific techniques to identify criminals. His faithful horse, Charcoal (or "Charky"), helps Pearson to track down the culprits. The radio shows, some of which are available on the Internet, are reenactments of actual Texas Ranger cases.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Top Dog is a film starring Chuck Norris, and Walker, Texas Ranger is a TV series also starring Chuck Norris. Since Top Dog is a film, it's likely that the cast member is from the TV series Walker, Texas Ranger.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In 1700 several hundred French Huguenots migrated from England to the colony of Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them land grants in Lower Norfolk County. When they arrived, colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County. Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School.', 'In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas, where they developed new plantations.']

The Orthodox believe that she was and remained a virgin before and after Christ\'s birth. The Theotokia (i.e., hymns to the Theotokos) are an essential part of the Divine Services in the Eastern Church and their positioning within the liturgical sequence effectively places the Theotokos in the most prominent place after Christ. Within the Orthodox tradition, the order of the saints begins with: The Theotokos, Angels, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers, Martyrs, etc. giving the Virgin Mary precedence over the angels. She is also proclaimed as the "Lady of the Angels".', 'However Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the Maximian persecution of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. Secondly, the Festal Epistles state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328. The accusation must have seemed plausible. The Orthodox Church places his year of birth around 297.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.", "Franz Schubert's Piano Sonata in A minor, D 784 (posthumously published as Op. 143), is one of Schubert's major compositions for the piano. Schubert composed the work in February 1823, perhaps as a response to his illness the year before. It was however not published until 1839, eleven years after his death. It was given the opus number 143 and a dedication to Felix Mendelssohn by its publishers. The D 784 sonata, Schubert's last to be in three movements, is seen by many to herald a new era in Schubert's output for the piano, and to be a profound and sometimes almost obsessively tragic work."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The composer of Gloria in D Major is Antonio Vivaldi. Vivaldi was born in Venice. According to the text, plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The U.S. Congress first established a Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1884 with the Bureau of Labor Act, to collect information about labor and employment. This bureau was under the Department of the Interior. The Bureau started collecting economic data in 1884, and published their first report in 1886. Later, the Bureau of Labor became an independent Department of Labor but lacked executive rank. It became a bureau again within the Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established February 15, 1903. President William Howard Taft signed the March 4, 1913 (the last day of his presidency) bill, establishing the Department of Labor as a Cabinet - level Department. William B. Wilson was appointed as the first Secretary of Labor on March 5, 1913 by President Wilson. Secretary Wilson chaired the first meeting of the International Labour Organization in October 1919, even though the U.S. was not yet a member.', "Full - time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his / her employer. Full - time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part - time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sickleave, and health insurance. Part - time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part - time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part - time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part - time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full - time employment or part - time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 35 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full - time and therefore eligible for benefits."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Zhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak Wu, but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other varieties of Chinese are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; Mandarin and Huizhou dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while Min dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See Hangzhou dialect, Shaoxing dialect, Ningbo dialect, Wenzhou dialect, Taizhou dialect, Jinhua dialect, and Quzhou dialect for more information).', 'Quite a few words from the variety of Old Chinese spoken in the state of Wu (where the ancestral language of Min and Wu dialect families originated and which was likely influenced by the Chinese spoken in the state of Chu which itself was not founded by Chinese speakers),[citation needed] and later words from Middle Chinese as well, have retained the original meanings in Hokkien, while many of their counterparts in Mandarin Chinese have either fallen out of daily use, have been substituted with other words (some of which are borrowed from other languages while others are new developments), or have developed newer meanings. The same may be said of Hokkien as well, since some lexical meaning evolved in step with Mandarin while others are wholly innovative developments.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a military expedition that led to the presence of Min dialects on the border with Zhejiang. From the relevant texts, I know that Min dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian, not Zhejiang. However, I also know that Chen Zheng settled in Zhangzhou, which is in Fujian province, and that Chen Zheng led a military expedition.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.', 'Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources. Most of the most densely populated cities are in Southeast Asia, though Cairo and Lagos in Africa also fall into this category.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Tammy Leitner's city of birth is San Diego (from "tamara leitner, born in, san diego"). There is no information about San Diego's population density in 2009. However, there is information about Guam's population density (from "guam, has density, 297/km²"), but Guam is not Tammy Leitner's city of birth.

Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Hurricane Charley was the first of four individual hurricanes to produce winds of at least 75 mph in Florida in a single season -- Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. It was the third named storm, the second hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15, and at its peak intensity it attained 150 mph (240 km / h) winds, making it a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir - Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength, making it the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in 1992.', 'Typically tropical cyclones pass offshore once they reach the northern portion of the Atlantic coast of Florida. As such, the hurricane risk for Daytona Beach is significantly lower than areas of southern Florida like Miami and Key West. The 2004 hurricane season was by far the most active in the Daytona Beach area in the last 50 years. However, since 1950 there has only been one direct hit by a tropical cyclone to the Daytona Beach area, Hurricane Donna in 1960.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine, Napoleon III and the French high command planned a seaborne invasion of northern Germany as soon as war began. The French expected the invasion to divert German troops and to encourage Denmark to join in the war, with its 50,000-strong army and the Royal Danish Navy. It was discovered that Prussia had recently built defences around the big North German ports, including coastal artillery batteries with Krupp heavy artillery, which with a range of 4,000 yards (3,700 m), had double the range of French naval guns. The French Navy lacked the heavy guns to engage the coastal defences and the topography of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible.', 'The word "Slavs" was used in the national anthem of the Slovak Republic (1939–1945), Yugoslavia (1943–1992) and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003), later Serbia and Montenegro (2003–2006).']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Ivo Werner's country of origin is Czechoslovakia. The military branch equivalent to the US Air Defense Artillery was unprepared for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia was vital to the defense of Greece, and Czechoslovakia was a possible Soviet target, similar to Yugoslavia. The word "Slavs" was used in the national anthem of Yugoslavia.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Song offers no clue to its author or to the date, place, or circumstances of its composition. The superscription states that it is ``Solomon's '', but even if this is meant to identify the author, it can not be read as strictly as a similar modern statement. The most reliable evidence for its date is its language: Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew after the end of the Babylonian exile in the late 6th century BCE, and the evidence of vocabulary, morphology, idiom and syntax clearly points to a late date, centuries after King Solomon to whom it is traditionally attributed. It has parallels with Mesopotamian and Egyptian love poetry from the first half of the 1st millennium, and with the pastoral idylls of Theocritus, a Greek poet who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century; as a result of these conflicting signs, speculation ranges from the 10th to the 2nd centuries BCE, with the language supporting a date around the 3rd century.", 'Pacem in terris () was a papal encyclical issued by Pope John XXIII on 11 April 1963 on the rights and obligations of individuals and of the state, as well as the proper relations between states. It emphasized human dignity and equality among all people, and made mention of issues such as the rights of women, nuclear non-proliferation, and the United Nations, all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with cancer in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical\'s completion. Biographer Peter Hebblethwaite called it Pope John\'s "last will and testament". Published on Holy Thursday, the Pope called it his "Easter gift".']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Pacem in Terris' author is Pope John XXIII. Pope John XXIII died on 3 June 1963. The city where Pope John XXIII died is Vatican City. The Governor of Vatican City is held by the Pope, so the Governor of the city where Pacem in Terris' author died is Pope John Paul II. Pope John Paul II reigned from 1978 to 2005.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.', "By the early 1960s, the US had begun placing stiff import tariffs on certain vehicles. The so - called ``chicken tax ''of 1964 placed a 25% tax on imported light trucks. In response to the tariff, Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the US by the early 1980s."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks when Nissan, Hino, and Honda opened US assembly plants. From the relevant texts, I know that Hino is the creator of the Hino Dutro, and Honda is the maker of the Acura Legend. I also know that Nissan, Honda, and Toyota were affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints and opened US assembly plants. Additionally, I know that Toyota, Nissan Motor Co., and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the US by the early 1980s.

Direct answer: Early 1980s

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Allen, also known as Allen City is a ghost town in Pima County in southern Arizona. It was founded fifty miles southeast of Ajo, c. 1880. By 1886, the post office closed and the town has been abandoned since.', 'Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Allen is a ghost town in Pima County. Pima County is in Arizona. Tucson is in Pima County. The question is asking about the wettest year in Tucson. The wettest year has 24.17 in.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.', 'In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about a military expedition in a province that borders Zhejiang to the south. From the relevant facts, I know that Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangxi to the south. Then, I search for a military expedition led by someone in Jiangxi, but I couldn't find any information. However, I found a relevant text that mentions Chen Zheng leading a military expedition in Fujian, which is not the correct province. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is unknown.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: Chen Zheng

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Diego Armando Maradona Sinagra (born 20 September 1986) is an Italian footballer and beach soccer player, who plays for A.S.D San Giorgio in Italy. He is the son of Argentine national footballer Diego Maradona.', "Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Diego Sinagra's father is Diego Maradona. Diego Maradona signed for Barcelona for £5 million.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Villa Welgelegen is a historical building in Haarlem, the Netherlands, which currently houses the offices of the provincial executives of North Holland. Located at the north end of a public park in the city, it is an example of neoclassical architecture, unusual for its style in the Netherlands.', "The occupation of the Baltic states was the military occupation of the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- by the Soviet Union under the auspices of the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact on 14 June 1940 followed by their incorporation into the USSR as constituent republics, unrecognised by most Western powers. On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the USSR and within weeks occupied the Baltic territories. In July 1941, the Baltic territory was incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland of the Third Reich. As a result of the Baltic Offensive of 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and trapped the remaining German forces in the Courland pocket until their formal surrender in May 1945. The Soviet ``annexation occupation ''(Annexionsbesetzung or occupation sui generis) of the Baltic states lasted until August 1991, when the Baltic states regained independence."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.', 'George Sarton, the author of The History of Science, described Ibn Sīnā as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history" and called him "the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times." He was one of the Islamic world\'s leading writers in the field of medicine. Along with Rhazes, Abulcasis, Ibn al-Nafis, and al-Ibadi, Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European Renaissance. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle\'s views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle\'s position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge. Aristotle\'s dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna\'s linking of Galen\'s medical writings with Aristotle\'s philosophical writings in the Canon of Medicine (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna\'s importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the Canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, princeps medicorum ("prince of physicians").']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions "one of the greatest thinkers" who proposed explanations for the origins of earthquakes and the formation of mountains. This phrase is similar to the description of Ibn Sīnā in the relevant text, which states that George Sarton described Ibn Sīnā as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history". Additionally, the text mentions that Ibn Sīnā proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains and the origin of earthquakes.

NHHS offers specialized 4-credit courses which allow students to learn principles of resource management and environmental studies, which help them to gain employment in resource-based careers.', 'Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In 334 BC, Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid emperor, Darius III, at the Battle of Issus. Following the premature death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. In the middle of the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran, and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between Romans and Parthians began, culminating in the Roman–Parthian Wars. The Parthian Empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries, until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire. Together with their neighboring arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantines, they made up the world's two most dominant powers at the time, for over four centuries.", 'Contrarily, having so firmly entrenched themselves into Greek affairs, the Romans now completely ignored the rapidly disintegrating Seleucid empire (perhaps because it posed no threat); and left the Ptolemaic kingdom to decline quietly, while acting as a protector of sorts, in as much as to stop other powers taking Egypt over (including the famous line-in-the-sand incident when the Seleucid Antiochus IV Epiphanes tried to invade Egypt). Eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid empire caused the Roman proconsul Pompey the Great to abolish the Seleucid rump state, absorbing much of Syria into the Roman republic. Famously, the end of Ptolemaic Egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Anthony and Augustus Caesar. After the defeat of Anthony and his lover, the last Ptolemaic monarch, Cleopatra VII at the Battle of Actium, Augustus invaded Egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom. He thereby completed both the destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms and the Roman republic, and ended (in hindsight) the Hellenistic era.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Throughout the following month, the Yongle Emperor and his court showered the Karmapa with presents. At Linggu Temple in Nanjing, he presided over the religious ceremonies for the Yongle Emperor\'s deceased parents, while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the Emperor\'s seal. During his stay in Nanjing, Deshin Shekpa was bestowed the title "Great Treasure Prince of Dharma" by the Yongle Emperor. Elliot Sperling asserts that the Yongle Emperor, in bestowing Deshin Shekpa with the title of "King" and praising his mystical abilities and miracles, was trying to build an alliance with the Karmapa as the Mongols had with the Sakya lamas, but Deshin Shekpa rejected the Yongle Emperor\'s offer. In fact, this was the same title that Kublai Khan had offered the Sakya Phagpa lama, but Deshin Shekpa persuaded the Yongle Emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other Tibetan Buddhist sects.', 'In his usurpation of the throne from the Jianwen Emperor (r. 1398–1402), the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao, and like his father, the Hongwu Emperor, the Yongle Emperor was "well-disposed towards Buddhism", claims Rossabi. On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor. A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa. The letter of invitation reads,']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions the Yongle emperor greeting the person to whom the edict was addressed. From the relevant texts, we know that the Yongle emperor greeted Deshin Shekpa, the 5th Karmapa Lama, in Nanjing. Therefore, we need to find the football club from Nanjing. From the relevant facts, we know that Jiangsu Sainty is a football club from Nanjing.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The city is roughly bisected by the North Canadian River (recently renamed the Oklahoma River inside city limits). The North Canadian once had sufficient flow to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding areas, including the central business district and the original Oklahoma City Zoo. In the 1940s, a dam was built on the river to manage the flood control and reduced its level. In the 1990s, as part of the citywide revitalization project known as MAPS, the city built a series of low-water dams, returning water to the portion of the river flowing near downtown. The city has three large lakes: Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser, in the northwestern quarter of the city; and the largest, Lake Stanley Draper, in the sparsely populated far southeast portion of the city.', "Chinese environmental activist and journalist Ma Jun warned in 2006 that China is facing a water crisis that includes water shortages, water pollution and a deterioration in water quality. Ma argued that 400 out of 600 cities in China are facing water shortages to varying degrees, including 30 out of the 32 largest cities. Furthermore, Ma argued, discharges of waste water have increased continually over the years 2001 - 2006, and that 300 million peasants' drinking water is not safe. He warned: ``In the north, due to the drying up of the surface water, the underground water has been over-extracted. The water shortage in the north could have drastic affects because almost half of China's population lives on only 15 percent of its water. The situation is not sustainable. Though the south has abundant water, there is a lack of clean water due to serious water pollution. Even water - abundant deltas like the Yangtze and the Pearl River suffer from water shortages. ''"]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the population of an Italian city that's underwater. From the given facts, I found that Venice is a city in Italy, and it's situated on islands. Although it's not explicitly stated that Venice is underwater, it's known for its canals and being a city on water. I couldn't find any other Italian city that's underwater. However, I couldn't find the 2018 population of Venice in the given facts.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng (陳政), together with his son Chen Yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian. They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (王潮) and Wang Shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.', "Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and destroyed the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a military expedition in a place where there was a fight between Ming loyalists and Manchus. From the relevant texts, I found a passage that mentions a fight between Ming loyalists and Manchus in Jiangnan, where the Qing army led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached. However, this passage does not mention a military expedition led by someone specific. Another relevant fact mentions Chen Zheng leading a military expedition to pacify a rebellion in Fujian, but it does not seem to be related to a fight between Ming loyalists and Manchus.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Qui de nous deux ? (2003) is an album by French singer-songwriter Matthieu Chedid in his persona as -M-. It is his third full studio album, or the fourth if including the instrumental work Labo M which he had released earlier the same year. The title of the album and its best known track means 'Which of Us Two' reflecting the ongoing contrast between Chedid's real persona and that of his invented character -M-. The album's liner notes explain that the love discussed in that song are for the pink guitar that features on both the album cover and the surreal music video that accompanied the song. The pink guitar had been specially created to celebrate the birth of Chedid's daughter Billie in 2002.", 'The ballets of the late 19th Century -- particularly of those of Marius Petipa -- introduced the concept of the grand pas de deux, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of entrée and adagio by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale. During the 20th century, the grand pas de deux became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.']

Nono himself and Yuri Lyubimov wrote the libretto. It premiered at the Teatro alla Scala on 4 April 1975, conducted by Claudio Abbado. Lyubimov directed the original production. The UK premiere was at the 32nd Edinburgh Festival in 1978. In addition to vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra, the work incorporates taped sounds. This work is a product of Nono\'s strong political activism through the mid-1970s.', 'He studied under Giacomo Favretto, Alessandro Milesi, and Luigi Nono at the Academy of Fine Arts in his native Venice. In 1873, he exhibited in Venice: "Né sposo né figlio" and "Scena famigliare". In 1877 at Paris, "Les saltimbanques" and "Les pingeons de Saint Marc". He was active as a painter in Venice.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["After the 1972 baseball season, the Royals moved to Royals Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex. The Royals won the final game (and event) at Municipal Stadium, a 4 -- 0 win over the Texas Rangers on October 4, 1972, in also the final Major League game managed by Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Amos Otis scored the final run in Municipal Stadium history and Ed Kirkpatrick had the final hit. Four days prior Gene Tenace of the Oakland A's hit the final home run, and John Mayberry hit the final Royals home run the night before.", "The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston region. The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is located 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown Boston and 20 miles (32 km) northeast of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The 2017 American League Wild Card game was played at Yankee Stadium. The first home run at Yankee Stadium was hit in 1923. The relevant fact "first home run, was hit at, old yankee stadium" suggests that the first home run at the old Yankee Stadium was hit in 1923, but it does not provide information about the new Yankee Stadium. Since the question asks about the new stadium, I will assume it refers to the current Yankee Stadium. Unfortunately, I do not have information about who hit the first home run at the current Yankee Stadium.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War, and the British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.", "A total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Real Madrid winning the title a record 33 times and Barcelona 25 times. After Athletic Bilbao claimed several titles in the league's early years, Real Madrid dominated the championship from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when Athletic and neighbours Real Sociedad each won the league twice. From the 1990s onwards, Barcelona (15 titles) and Real Madrid (9 titles) were both prominent, though La Liga also saw other champions, including Atlético Madrid, Valencia, and Deportivo de La Coruña. In the 2010s, Atlético Madrid became increasingly strong, forming a trio alongside Real Madrid and Barcelona which occupied the podium places exclusively."]

After the conflict, Britain gained control of Florida. Paco Godia's birthplace is Barcelona, Spain. Real Madrid is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Rotrude (or sometimes referred to as Hruodrud/Hruodhaid) (775/778 – 6 June 810) was a Frankish princess, the second daughter of Charlemagne from his marriage to Hildegard.', 'Father of Frankenstein is a 1995 novel by Christopher Bram which speculates on the last days of the life of film director James Whale. Whale directed such groundbreaking works as the 1931 "Frankenstein" and 1933\'s "The Invisible Man" and was a pioneer in the horror film genre.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Rotrude's father is Charlemagne. Charlemagne's era is known as the Carolingian Renaissance. Many surnames have Italian origin, but there is no direct connection to Sylvester. Ancient tradition gives surnames according to father's name, but Sylvester is not a surname derived from Charlemagne's name.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["While varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. Real Madrid C.F. and FC Barcelona are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. The country's national football team won the UEFA European Football Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.", 'The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind, following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the award - winning but controversial 1938 film Olympia.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions a football star who backed out due to relay controversy. From the relevant texts, I found that Diego Maradona was scheduled to open the relay but pulled out of it. He is a footballer who played for Barcelona.

The show features the voices of series creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Mila Kunis in the roles of the Griffin family. The executive producers for the seventh season were MacFarlane, Danny Smith, David Goodman and Chris Sheridan. Goodman and Sheridan served as showrunners for season seven.", 'Friends with Benefits is a 2011 American romantic comedy film directed by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in the lead roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding sex to their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it each time they are together.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["McCauley Mountain (also known as McAuley Mountain or McCauley's Mountain) is a mountain in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Its official elevation is above sea level. The mountain is a synclinal mountain. Main rock formations on and near it include the Mauch Chunk Formation and the Pottsville Formation. There are also coal deposits on it. The coal deposits were discovered in 1826 and mining of them began in the 1850s. However, coal mining on the east side of the mountain proved to be a commercial failure. There are a number of ponds on the mountain, some of which were created during the mining. However, others are natural vernal pools. Some of the ponds are surrounded by hemlocks and deciduous trees. Major streams near the mountain include Scotch Run, Beaver Run, and Catawissa Creek. The mountain is named after Alexander McCauley, who settled there in 1774.", 'Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: McCauley Mountain is in Columbia County, Pennsylvania. Portland is likely referring to Portland, Oregon, not Portland, Pennsylvania. Oregon has a mountain range called the Oregon Coast Range. Since McCauley Mountain is in Pennsylvania, we need to find mountains in Oregon. 

Direct answer: Cascade Range
TRUE ANSWER: Tualatin Mountains

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Thrill of a Lifetime is a television reality series (before that term was coined) created by Sidney M. Cohen (who also directed many of the episodes) and Willie Stein. It was telecast from 1981 to 1988 in Canada on the CTV network. "Thrill of a Lifetime" gave viewers the chance to live their dreams, with thrills ranging from daredevil adventures to the romantic. The program was hosted by Doug Paulson, with Teri Austin joining as co-host later in its run. One of the program\'s more notable episodes was in its first season, when it arranged for an aspiring model named Shannon Tweed to pose for Playboy, which led to her becoming 1982\'s Playmate of the Year and launching an acting career.', 'Heirs to the Dare is a reality television show which premiered on March 10, 2014 on The Discovery Channel. The show followed three stunt performers in the footsteps of daredevils past, primarily Evel Knievel, to perform dangerous stunts today. The three stunt performers are Henry “The Pitbull” Rife, Bubba Blackwell, and Super Joe Reed. Discovery describes the show as "Bubba, Henry, and Super Joe soar through the air on bikes and ATVs for the thrill of it. They break bones, but they also break records."']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question asks about the record label of the Thrill of a Lifetime performer. From the given facts, I found that Thrill of a Lifetime is a television reality series, not a music performer. Therefore, it does not have a record label.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (Transcaucasian SFSR or TSFSR), also known as the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union that existed from 1922 to 1936. It comprised Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. As they were separated from Russia by the Caucasus Mountains, they were known traditionally as the Transcaucasian Republics. Created ostensibly to consolidate the economic situation of the region, the TSFSR was also useful in consolidating Bolshevik control over the states. It was one of the four republics to sign the treaty establishing the Soviet Union in 1922.', 'Georgia, formally the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (Georgian SSR; ; ), was one of the republics of the Soviet Union from its inception in 1922 to its breakup in 1991. Coterminous with the present-day republic of Georgia, it was based on the traditional territory of Georgia, which had existed as a series of independent states in the Caucasus prior to annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801. Independent again as the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918, it was annexed by Soviet forces, who invaded it in 1921. The Georgian SSR was subsequently formed, though from 1922 until 1936 it was a part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, which existed as a union republic within the USSR. From November 18, 1989, the Georgian SSR declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. The republic was renamed the Republic of Georgia on November 14, 1990, and subsequently became independent before the dissolution of the Soviet Union on April 9, 1991, whereupon each former SSR became a sovereign state.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the party that would have maintained power if a treaty was signed in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This treaty is likely referring to the new union treaty that would have converted the Soviet Union into a federation. If this treaty was signed, the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic would have maintained power. However, President Yeltsin suspended this party, which means he is the one who suspended the party that would have maintained power if the treaty was signed.

Direct answer: President Yeltsin

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['By the end of May, drafts were formally presented. In mid-June, the main Tripartite negotiations started. The discussion was focused on potential guarantees to central and east European countries should a German aggression arise. The USSR proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the Baltic states would constitute an "indirect aggression" towards the Soviet Union. Britain opposed such proposals, because they feared the Soviets\' proposed language could justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states, or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany. The discussion about a definition of "indirect aggression" became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted must be entered into simultaneously with any political agreement.', "Hero of Socialist Labour () was an honorary title in Albania and other Warsaw Pact countries. It was the highest degree of distinction for exceptional achievements in national economy and culture. It provided a similar status to the title People's Hero of Albania that was awarded for heroic deeds, but unlike the latter, was awarded to citizens who contributed to the development of Albania's industry, agriculture, transportation, trade, science and technology and promoted the might and the glory of Albania."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a group of nations that the People's Socialist Republic of Albania was a member of, which was controlled by one country. This group of nations is likely the Warsaw Pact, as Albania was a member of it. The organization Eisenhower would not discuss during the campaign is likely NATO. The question is asking when the country controlling the Warsaw Pact agreed to a unified Germany inside NATO.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The song was written by Eagles' members Randy Meisner, Don Henley and Glenn Frey. Meisner, who sang lead on it, says the song began as his solo composition. As it remained unfinished when time came for the One of These Nights album to be recorded, Henley and Frey assisted Meisner in completing it. Meisner's performance of the song was popular with the audience in Eagles' concerts, but disputes over his reluctance to perform it would also directly lead to Meisner's departure from the band.", "One Night in America is the twenty first studio album by American blues singer and harmonica player Charlie Musselwhite. It was released in February 2002 on Telarc record label and it was Musselwhite's debut and only release on this label."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Mud Bath is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by David Bomberg. The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period. Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist.", 'Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W. Nevinson and Dora Carrington. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['USB mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.', 'USB device communication is based on pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it\'s rare to have so many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The device that was designed to standardize connection of computer peripherals is USB. USB devices can operate in low-power mode, which has a 100 mA maximum. However, devices can also be classified as high-power devices. The question asks for the maximum load drawn, so I will consider the high-power mode. 

Direct answer: 25.5 W

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified the area into the first of many empires in 625 BC, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Parthian Empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the Sassanid Dynasty in 224 AD, under which Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than four centuries.", "Eudamidas I (Greek: Εὐδαμίδας, reigned 331 BC – c. 305 BC) was a Spartan king of the Eurypontid line, son of Archidamus III and brother of Agis III, whom he succeeded. He married the wealthy Archidamia, and they had two children, Archidamus IV and Agesistrata. There is evidence that Eudamidas I owned the half of his wife's wealth in land. His reign Sparta was a time of peace. Pausanias devotes more space to Agis II (427–400 BC) and Agesilaus II (400–360 BC) than to other kings, such as Agis III (338–330 BC) and Eudamidas I, whose lives he passed by briefly, as the Eurypontid line ‘fades’."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel.", 'The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called "Human rights and intellectual property" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should "focus more on the needs of developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself".']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions Yekaterina Fesenko's country of citizenship, which is Russia (from the fact "yekaterina fesenko, country of birth, russia"). It also mentions imperialist power, which is related to the concept of imperialism (from the fact "lenin, declared, imperialism"). The Korean conflict is likely referring to the Korean War (from the relevant text). The arguer is likely Mao Zedong, who argued that the Soviet Union was an imperialist power (from the fact "mao zedong, argued, soviet union"). Mao sent veterans to Korea and promised to move the army to support North Korea (from the facts "mao, sent, veterans to korea" and "mao, promised to move, army").

Direct answer: China

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).', 'José Miguel Cabrera Torres (born April 18, 1983), commonly known as Miguel Cabrera and nicknamed "Miggy", is a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He is the first baseman for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Since his debut in 2003 he has been a two-time\xa0American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, a four-time AL batting champion, and an 11-time MLB All-Star. He has played at first and third base for most of his major league career, but primarily played left and right field before 2006. He claimed the 17th MLB Triple Crown in 2012, the first to do so in 45 seasons.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega, which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988. Nintendo\'s intention, however, was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers\' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo\'s "iron-clad terms" made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami\'s Ultra Games label; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.', 'During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami\'s "Ultra Games" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega\'s console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo\'s other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about Nintendo's limit on games per developer per year on the platform of the video game Xexyz. Xexyz was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). According to my memory, Nintendo had strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the United Kingdom, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch. The House of Commons is composed of 650 (soon to be 600) members who are directly elected by British citizens to represent single - member constituencies. The leader of a Party that wins more than half the seats, or less than half but is able to gain the support of smaller parties to achieve a majority in the house is invited by the Monarch to form a government. The House of Lords is a body of long - serving, unelected members: Lords Temporal - 92 of whom inherit their titles (and of whom 90 are elected internally by members of the House to lifetime seats), 588 of whom have been appointed to lifetime seats, and Lords Spiritual - 26 bishops, who are part of the house while they remain in office.', "The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress. If the Minority Leader's party takes control of the House, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats, the Minority Leader is usually the party's top choice for Speaker for the next Congress, while the Minority Whip is typically in line to become Majority Leader. The Minority Leader usually meets with the Majority Leader and the Speaker to discuss agreements on controversial issues."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking when the majority party in the body that approves members of the American Cabinet gained control of the House. The body that approves members of the American Cabinet is the Senate. However, the question is asking about the House, which is the House of Representatives. The majority party in the House of Representatives is the party that has the most seats. From the given texts, I found that "party control, changed hands in, house of representatives" but there is no specific date mentioned.

Reid, with additional writing by Daryl Simmons.', "The standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on the ``Indoor League ''television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host Fred Trueman during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The performer of "Don't Be Cruel" is Bobby Brown. The question asks who he plays in "The Wire". I don't have any information about Bobby Brown playing a role in "The Wire". However, I have information about Sam Singleton playing Romeo in "Private Romeo", which is an adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet". But this is not related to "The Wire". I also have information about "The Wire" having a theme song, but it doesn't mention Bobby Brown.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).', "In Major League Baseball (MLB), the wild - card teams are the two teams in each of the two leagues (American and National) that have qualified for the postseason despite failing to win their division. Both teams in each league possess the two best winning percentages in their respective league after the three division winners. The wild card was first instituted in MLB in 1994, with one wild - card team per league advancing to the Division Series in the postseason to face a division winner. In 2012, the system was modified to add a second wild - card team per league and pit each league's wild - card teams against each other in a play - in game -- the MLB wild - card game -- the winner of which would then advance to the Division Series and play the team with the best record. This system ensures that the team with the second - best record in each league, after the three division winners and the team with the first - best record in the league that is a non-division winner, will also get a postseason berth, even if it is n't a division champion."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the opening day of the league in which the team with the most games in the series after which the MLB MVP is awarded plays. The MLB MVP is awarded after the World Series, which is the final series of the postseason. The team with the most games in the World Series is the team that wins the World Series, which is a team from either the American League or the National League. Therefore, we need to find the opening day of either the American League or the National League. From the relevant texts, we know that in 2018, all 30 teams opened the season on Thursday, March 29.

Direct answer: March 29
TRUE ANSWER: Thursday, March 29

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["After the end of WWII in 1945, the Allies divided the country into a northern area, protected by the Soviets, and a southern area protected primarily by the United States. In 1948, when the powers failed to agree on the formation of a single government, this partition became the modern states of North and South Korea. The peninsula was divided at the 38th Parallel: the ``Republic of Korea ''was created in the south, with the backing of the US and Western Europe, and the`` Democratic People's Republic of Korea'' in the north, with the backing of the Soviets and the communist People's Republic of China. The new premier of North Korea, Kim il - Sung launched the Korean War in 1950 in an attempt to reunify the country under Communist rule. After immense material and human destruction, the conflict ended with a cease - fire in 1953. The two nations officially remain at war because a peace treaty was never signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991.", 'Korea under Japanese rule began with the end of the short - lived Korean Empire in 1910 and ended at the conclusion of World War II in 1945. Japanese rule over Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan. A major stepping - stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then - Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan. The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions a leader who claimed that a republic had become an imperialist power. This sounds like Lenin's idea that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism. The question also mentions the Korean conflict, which took place from 1950 to 1953. Mao Zedong, a communist leader, argued that the Soviet Union had become an imperialist power. He also sent veterans to Korea to support the North Korean side in the war.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions a UK label, a company, ABC, and the network which hosts Hero High. From the facts, I know that Hero High is a cartoon series and it aired on NBC. So, the network which hosts Hero High is NBC. The company which, along with ABC and NBC, is the other major broadcaster based in NY is CBS. From the facts, I know that CBS acquired Oriole Records, which is a UK label.

Direct answer: Oriole Records

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["On December 8, 1941, the United States Congress declared war (Public Law 77 - 328, 55 STAT 795) on the Empire of Japan in response to that country's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor the prior day. It was formulated an hour after the Infamy Speech of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Japan had sent a message for the United States to its embassy in Washington earlier, but because of problems at the embassy in decoding the very long message -- the high security level assigned to the declaration meant that only personnel with very high clearances could decode it, which slowed down the process -- it was not delivered to the U.S. Secretary of State until after the Pearl Harbor attack.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.', 'The design architecture of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, consisting of a host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the generation of iPod that started providing compatibility with the object designed to standardize connection of computer peripherals. From the relevant texts, I know that the object designed to standardize connection of computer peripherals is USB. I also know that iPod is a portable media player, which is a type of computer peripheral. From the relevant facts, I found that iPod nano is a portable media player designed by Apple Inc. and it has generations. However, I couldn't find a specific fact that mentions the exact generation of iPod that started providing compatibility with USB.

Direct answer: Unknown

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The English Church was brought back under papal authority in 1553 and doctrinal and liturgical conformity at the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary I. The restoration of papal authority was celebrated by the majority of the nation and enforced by the Marian persecutions against Protestants. Her harshness was a success but at the cost of alienating a fairly large section of English society which had been moving away from some traditional Catholic devotional practices. The English it seems were quite caught up with the reforming movement on the Continent. At the time they were neither Calvinist nor Lutheran, but certainly leaning toward Protestantism (and by the late 16th century, were certainly Protestant).', 'Despite Martin Luther\'s harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. "Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety." Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the "Papists" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints\' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["In the following century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.", 'San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro (Italian for "Saint Peter in Golden Sky") is a Roman Catholic basilica (and a former cathedral) of the Augustinians in Pavia, Italy, in the Lombardy region. Its name refers to the mosaics of gold leaf behind glass tesserae that decorates the ceiling of the apse. The plain exterior is of brick, with sandstone quoins and window framing. The paving of the church floor is now lower than the modern street level of Piazza San Pietro in Ciel d\'Oro, which lies before its façade.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Mount Everest, the highest mountain peak in the world, is located in Nepal. Mountaineering and other types of adventure tourism and ecotourism are important attractions for visitors. The world heritage site Lumbini, birthplace of Gautama Buddha, is located in the south of the West region of Nepal (which despite the name is located in the centre of the country) and there are other important religious pilgrimage sites throughout the country. The tourist industry is seen as a way to alleviate poverty and achieve greater social equity in the country. Tourism brings $471 ma year to Nepal.', "Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley massif, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills. In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F)."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Fabian Wrede class consists of three training ships used by Finnish Navy. The ships are used by the Naval academy of Finland for basic seamanship training, with particular emphasis on navigation in coastal and archipelago waters. The vessels in the class are "Fabian Wrede", "Wilhelm Carpelan" and "Axel von Fersen". All ships were built by Uudenkaupungin työvene Oy and commissioned between 2006 and 2008. The ships will replace the old Heikki class training ships.', 'When the Winter War broke out the Finnish Navy moved to occupy the de-militarized Åland Islands and to protect merchant shipping. In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Utö and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines ("Vesikko" and "Saukko") to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the ice-breakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air-defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.']

From the relevant texts, we know that the Fabian Wrede class consists of three training ships used by the Finnish Navy. The Finnish Navy was involved in the Winter War. Therefore, the operator of the Fabian Wrede-class training ship served in the Winter War.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the cast member of The Bad Man, which is a 1930 American Western film. The relevant text from my memory mentions the cast members of The Bad Man, including Walter Huston. However, there is no mention of any cast member being nominated for an award. But, I have a relevant fact that Corey Daniel Stoll, who is not a cast member of The Bad Man, received a Golden Globe nomination.

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The performer who recorded "A Day in the Life" is not Jane Siberry, as the question states "the performer who recorded A Day in the Life" and "a day in the life, by, jane siberry" is not a correct statement. The correct statement is "a day in the life, released in, 1997". Then, I searched for the performer who released "A Day in the Life" in 1997, but couldn't find any relevant information. However, I found that Ben Castle was born in 1973 and his father is Roy Castle. Then, I searched for Roy Castle's birthplace and found that Ben Castle's father, Roy Castle, was not born in the city with the castle in question. But, I found that Claus Philipp Maria Justinian was born in Stauffenberg Castle.

Direct answer: Stauffenberg Castle

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars. One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum (History of the Britons) and Annales Cambriae (Welsh Annals), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano - British leader who fought against the invading Anglo - Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum, a 9th - century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single - handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum.', 'Cherin was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth\'s "Historia Regum Britanniae". His father was King Porrex II and he was succeeded by his three sons in turn, Fulgenius, Edadus, and Andragius.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions a volcano named after a legendary King featured in Historia Regum Britanniae. From the relevant texts, I know that Historia Regum Britanniae is a collection of legends about the Britons and King Arthur. However, there is no direct mention of a volcano in the texts. But, I have a fact that Edinburgh Castle was built on a rock, which is formed by an extinct volcano system. This might be the volcano mentioned in the question. Now, I need to find when this volcano last erupted. From the facts, I have that the most recent eruption of a volcano ended in 1950.

Direct answer: 1950
TRUE ANSWER: lava samples have been dated at 341 to 335 million years old

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["While many NHL, NBA, and NFL draftees will eventually reach their respective leagues, the vast majority of players selected in the first - year player draft will never play in a single MLB game, including many first - rounders. For example, only 31 of 52 first - round draft picks in the 1997 draft eventually made a big - league appearance, and only 13 of those 31 appeared in more than 100 games as of 2009. In 1997's sixth round, only five of the 30 players selected eventually made a big league appearance, and only two of those five (Tim Hudson and Matt Wise) played more than 40 innings in the majors. Further illustrating the unpredictability of the draft's middle and later rounds, none of the 30 players selected in the 18th round ever reached the major leagues, but the 19th round eventually produced an all - star and World Series MVP, David Eckstein.", 'The 2016 Major League Baseball All - Star Game was the 87th edition of the Major League Baseball All - Star Game. The game was hosted by the San Diego Padres and was played at Petco Park on July 12, 2016. It was televised nationally on Fox. The American League All - Stars defeated the National League All - Stars by a score of 4 -- 2 to win home field advantage for the 2016 World Series (which went to the Cleveland Indians). This was also the last time home - field advantage for the World Series was determined by the outcome of the All - Star Game.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the all-star game of the league whose member played in the most championship series which precede the MVP award. From the facts, I know that the Oakland Athletics won 9 championship series. The MVP award is given in the National League since 1949. So, the league whose member played in the most championship series which precede the MVP award is the American League. The all-star game is televised by Fox.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth.', "Soccer in the United States is governed by the United States Soccer Federation. The organization governs most levels of soccer in the country, including the national teams, professional leagues, and the amateur game with the exception of colleges and high schools. As of May 2015, over 24.4 million people play soccer in the United States. In 2017, Gallup reported that soccer was the third-most played team sport in the U.S., behind only basketball and American football. The popularity of the sport in the U.S. has been growing since the 1960s and 1970s, and received a significant boost when the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. It is the fourth most popular sport in the United States behind American football, baseball and basketball, and is the second fastest growing sport in America, surpassed only by lacrosse."]

The plot follows a pirate named Burger Beard, who steals the Krabby Patty secret formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob and his friends must travel to the surface to confront Burger Beard and get the formula back.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about a character in SpongeBob SquarePants with the same name as the creature that annelid larvae live like. Annelid larvae live like worms, so the character must be named Worm or something similar. The only character that comes to mind is Gary the Snail, but he's not a worm. However, Gary is a pet, and his owner is SpongeBob. So, the character with the same name as the creature that annelid larvae live like might be SpongeBob himself. According to the memory, Tom Kenny voices SpongeBob SquarePants.

Direct answer: Tom Kenny

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States is often made by government, public health and public policy analysts. The two countries had similar healthcare systems before Canada changed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per - capita basis and as a percentage of GDP. In 2006, per - capita spending for health care in Canada was US $3,678; in the U.S., US $6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics do n't take into account population differences.", 'Starting in 1910, the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft. In 1910, Mexico was having a civil war, peasant rebels fighting government soldiers. The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property. In 1916, Pancho Villa, a major rebel leader, attacked Columbus, New Mexico, prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917. They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918. The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and other allies. U.S. troops were sent to the Western Front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war. With the armistice in November 1918, the army once again decreased its forces.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the last soldier of the conflict that saw the government getting involved in healthcare to die. This conflict is likely the American Civil War, as it was a significant event in US history that led to the government's involvement in healthcare, particularly with the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau, which provided medical care to former slaves. Albert Henry Woolson was the last surviving member of the Union Army, and James Hard was another veteran of the American Civil War. However, the last soldier to die is likely Albert Henry Woolson.

Direct answer: Albert Henry Woolson

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Thomas Baring, known as "Tom", was the tenth child (fifth of second marriage) of Henry Baring of Cromer Hall, and younger full brother of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke. Like his brother, Baring was involved in the family banking business, beginning his career in the Liverpool office of Barings Bank. He later moved to New York City to join Kidder Peabody. When, in 1890, Kidder Peabody split its dual Boston-New York firm, Baring became a partner in the separated New York firm. He and another Kidder-Peabody alumnus, George C. Magoun, formed Baring, Magoun. Both houses continued as North American agents for Barings.', "Richard spent his reign focused on protecting his possessions in France and fighting in the Third Crusade; his brother, John, inherited England in 1199 but lost Normandy and most of Aquitaine after several years of war with France. John fought successive, increasingly expensive, campaigns in a bid to regain these possessions. John's efforts to raise revenues, combined with his fractious relationships with many of the English barons, led to confrontation in 1215, an attempt to restore peace through the signing of the Magna Carta, and finally the outbreak of the First Barons' War. John died having fought the rebel barons and their French backers to a stalemate, and royal power was re-established by barons loyal to the young Henry III. England's power structures remained unstable and the outbreak of the Second Barons' War in 1264 resulted in the king's capture by Simon de Montfort. Henry's son, Edward, defeated the rebel factions between 1265 and 1267, restoring his father to power."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"Neighbors" is a short story written by Raymond Carver in 1971. It first appeared in "Esquire magazine" in 1971. It was published in the collection "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" in 1976, in the compilation "Where I\'m Calling From" in 1989, and again in "Short Cuts" in 1993.', 'Between 1999 and 2006, Bicycling magazine named Boston three times as one of the worst cities in the US for cycling; regardless, it has one of the highest rates of bicycle commuting. In 2008, as a consequence of improvements made to bicycling conditions within the city, the same magazine put Boston on its "Five for the Future" list as a "Future Best City" for biking, and Boston\'s bicycle commuting percentage increased from 1% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2009. The bikeshare program called Hubway launched in late July 2011, logging more than 140,000 rides before the close of its first season. The neighboring municipalities of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline joined the Hubway program in summer 2012.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Del Moral modernized curricula during his time as director of the Faculty of Architecture (UNAM) (1944–1949), incorporating philosophies acquired from like-minded architects such as Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology as well as Mexican philosophy on esthetic espoused by Dr. Jose Gaos in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature (UNAM). He dedicated a large amount of his academic life to lecturing both domestically and abroad, and published books and essays on the evolution of architectural styles. He theorized about functionalism in Mexico and debated controversial issues of his time, such as the integration of plastic arts into architecture, and promoted the conservation of cities, approaching architecture in a way that could find balance between traditional and modern styles.', 'Harvard has been highly ranked by many university rankings. In particular, it has consistently topped the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) since 2003, and the THE World Reputation Rankings since 2011, when the first time such league tables were published. When the QS and Times were published in partnership as the THE-QS World University Rankings during 2004-2009, Harvard had also been regarded the first in every year. The University\'s undergraduate program has been continuously among the top two in the U.S. News & World Report. In 2014, Harvard topped the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP). It was ranked 8th on the 2013-2014 PayScale College Salary Report and 14th on the 2013 PayScale College Education Value Rankings. From a poll done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is the second most commonly named "dream college", both for students and parents in 2013, and was the first nominated by parents in 2009. In 2011, the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities ranked Harvard 1st university in the world in terms of number of alumni holding CEO position in Fortune Global 500 companies.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People\'s Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People\'s Liberation Army\'s (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to "American aggression in the guise of the UN".', "Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces -- supported by the Soviet Union and China -- moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty - one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about someone who argued that Boris Lagutin's country of citizenship had become an imperialist power and where they declared they would intervene in the Korean conflict. Boris Lagutin is a Soviet boxer, so his country of citizenship is the Soviet Union. The relevant text from memory mentions Mao Zedong reporting to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force.

Direct answer: Politburo
TRUE ANSWER: the Politburo

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in Székesfehérvár (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the Last Judgement above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.', "Cork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods. The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the Red Abbey. There are two cathedrals in the city; St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the Catholic cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Protestant faith and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect William Burges."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the place where the head of the catholic region named after the same saint as the Dakovo Cathedral. Dakovo Cathedral is dedicated to St. Peter. The head of the catholic region named after St. Peter is the Vatican City. Vatican City became its own country when the Lateran Treaty was signed on 11 February 1929.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Wang Yue (), also known as "Little Yue Yue" (), was a two-year-old Chinese girl who was run over by two vehicles on the afternoon of 13 October 2011 in a narrow road in Foshan, Guangdong. As she lay bleeding on the road for more than seven minutes, at least 18 passers-by skirted around her body, ignoring her. She was eventually helped by a female rubbish scavenger and sent to a hospital for treatment, but succumbed to her injuries and died eight days later. The closed-circuit television recording of the incident was uploaded onto the Internet, and quickly stirred widespread reaction in China and overseas. Many commentators saw this as indicative of a growing apathy in contemporary Chinese society.', "Since 1980, China has established special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province and Xiamen in Fujian Province, and designated the entire province of Hainan as a special economic zone. In August 1980, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed ``Regulations for The Special Economy Zone of Guangdong Province ''and officially designated a portion of Shenzhen as the Shenzhen Special Economy Zone (SSEZ)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Wang Yue died in Foshan, Guangdong province. Foshan was under control of Japanese during the First Sino-Japanese War. The First Sino-Japanese War ended in April 1895. Therefore, the Japanese got to Foshan and the rest of Guangdong province before 1895.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The Prime Minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen. It is also known as the cabinet. The cabinet carries out the country's domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.", "The One Hundred Fourteenth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017, during the final two full years of Barack Obama's presidency. The 2014 elections gave the Republicans control of the Senate (and control of both houses of Congress) for the first time since the 109th Congress. With 248 seats in the House of Representatives and 54 seats in the Senate, this Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress of 1929 -- 1931."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking when the majority party in the House of Representatives gained control of the body that approves members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet is approved by the Senate. The 2014 elections gave the Republicans control of the Senate. Therefore, the majority party in the House of Representatives gained control of the body that approves members of the Cabinet in 2014.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"Desde El Principio" also came to be the duo\'s final album for the Sony Music Entertainment label, a company they after a series of mergers in various forms had been signed to for some fifteen years (CBS Records Spain, Epic Records Spain, CBS-Epic Spain, eventually a sublabel to Sony Music Spain, today a subsidiary to the multinational Sony BMG Music Entertainment conglomerate). In 2006 Azúcar Moreno returned to their previous label EMI Music for the album "Bailando Con Lola".', "ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, which, in turn, had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company, but then sold off). ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records. Also in 1951, Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records, whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Business @ the Speed of Thought is a book written by Bill Gates and Collins Hemingway in 1999. It discusses how business and technology are integrated, and explains how digital infrastructures and information networks can help someone get an edge on the competition.', 'The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system\'s ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, "That must be why we\'re not shipping Windows 98 yet." Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.']

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: Veoh's headquarters is located in San Diego, California. The Paramour Sessions is an album by Papa Roach, and Papa Roach is an American rock band formed in Vacaville, California. So, we need to find the ranking of San Diego in the top five largest urban areas of California.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municípios) with their own legislative council (câmara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a "little constitution", called "organic law" (lei orgânica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, "free municipality") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states\' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.', "Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2011), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2013)."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about city council terms in the city in the same county as Summit. From the relevant facts, I know that Summit is located in Pima County, Arizona. However, there is no direct information about the city council terms in the city in the same county as Summit. But, I have a relevant text that mentions the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms in a different context. Assuming this is a general rule, I can apply it to this case.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Classical India refers to the period when much of the Indian subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE). This period has been called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.', "The Secretary of State for India or India Secretary was the British Cabinet minister and the political head of the India Office responsible for the governance of the British Raj (India), Aden, and Burma. The post was created in 1858 when the East India Company's rule in Bengal ended and India except for the Princely States was brought under the direct administration of the government in London, beginning the official colonial period under the British Empire."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The aortic and pulmonary valves are located at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk respectively. These are also called the ``semilunar valves ''. These two arteries receive blood from the ventricles and their semilunar valves permit blood to be forced into the arteries, and prevent backflow from the arteries into the ventricles. These valves do not have chordae tendineae, and are more similar to the valves in veins than they are to the atrioventricular valves. The closure of the semilunar valves causes the second heart sound.", 'Humans have two lungs, a right lung and a left lung. They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the microscopic alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and lobules. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Classical India refers to the period when much of the Indian subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE). This period has been called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The Hindu-Arabic numerals, a positional numeral system, originated in India and was later transmitted to the West through the Arabs. Early Hindu numerals had only nine symbols, until 600 to 800 CE, when a symbol for zero was developed for the numeral system. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.', "The religious data on India Census 2011 was released by the Government of India on 25 August 2015. Hindus are 79.8% (966.3 million), while Muslims are 14.23% (172.2 million) in India. and Christians are 2.30% (28.7 million). According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The Permanent Settlement was introduced first in Bengal and Bihar, and then in the south district of Madras and Varanasi. The system eventually spread all over northern India by a series of regulations dated 1 May 1793. These regulations remained in place until the Charter Act of 1833. The other two systems prevalent in India were The Ryotwari System and The Mahalwari System.', "The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long - term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the company that abolished the dual system of government in Bengal. From the relevant facts, I found that the dual government was abolished in 1773. Also, I found that the British East India Company took control of the region and asserted its authority in 1773. Therefore, I can conclude that the company who abolished the dual system of government in Bengal is the British East India Company. However, the question is asking when the company was founded, not when it abolished the dual system. From the relevant facts, I found that the English East India Company was formed in 1600.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.', 'The history of Islam in Somalia is as old as the religion itself. The early persecuted Muslims fled to various places in the region, including the city of Zeila in modern-day northern Somalia, so as to seek protection from the Quraysh. Somalis were among the first populations on the continent to embrace Islam. With very few exceptions, Somalis are entirely Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi`i school of Islamic jurisprudence, although a few are also adherents of the Shia Muslim denomination.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question mentions the Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, which is not related to Thailand or Si Phan Don. Si Phan Don is a riverine archipelago in Laos, and Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire is related to Somalia, which is a country in Africa. The new coins were a proclamation of independence by the Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, but it's not clear how this is related to Thailand or Si Phan Don.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Springfield's original name was Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the ``Long Nine ''for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).", "Superior Drilling Company was a manufacturer of farming implements that formed in the late 1800' to 1903 in Springfield, Ohio, United States."]
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The city where Superior Drill Company is located is Springfield, Ohio (from the text "Superior Drilling Company was a manufacturer of farming implements that formed in the late 1800' to 1903 in Springfield, Ohio, United States."). The screenwriter of The Poor Boob is Margaret Mayo, who was born in Brownsville (from the fact "margaret mayo, born in, brownsville"). Brownsville is in the state of Pennsylvania (not explicitly stated, but implied). However, this information is not consistent with the given facts, as Springfield, Ohio is not the capital of Pennsylvania. The correct information is that Superior Drill Company is located in Springfield, Illinois (from the fact "superior drilling company, formed in, springfield"), and Margaret Mayo was born in Brownsville, Tennessee (not explicitly stated, but implied). The state where Margaret Mayo was born is Tennessee. The capital of Tennessee is Nashville, but Nashville is not the city where Superior Drill Company is located. Therefore, the correct answer is Springfield, Illinois, which became the capital of Illinois in 1839 (from the text "Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839.").

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The flow of cold, gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake. The cold water flows near the surface and at first doesn\'t mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake. But then, at the so-called Rheinbrech, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen. Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne ("Rhine Gutter") and Seerhein. Depending on the water level, this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.', 'A Jucy Lucy (sic) or Juicy Lucy is a cheeseburger that has the cheese inside the meat patty instead of on top, resulting in a melted core of cheese within the patty. Two bars in Minneapolis claim to be the inventor of the burger, though other bars and restaurants have created their own interpretations on the style.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The question is asking about the direction of flow of the body of water near the home of the Juicy Lucy. The Juicy Lucy is a cheeseburger, and from the relevant texts, we know that it is associated with Minneapolis. Minneapolis lies on the Minnesota River, but we need to find the direction of flow of the body of water near Minneapolis. Since Minneapolis has 13 lakes, we can't pinpoint the exact lake, but we know that the Mississippi River is also in Minnesota and borders Minneapolis. The direction of flow of the Mississippi River is not specified in the relevant facts, so we can't determine the exact direction of flow.

Direct answer: Unknown
TRUE ANSWER: rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards
