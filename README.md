# AriGraph: Learning Knowledge Graph World Models with Episodic Memory for LLM Agents

AriGraph is the architecture of external memory for large language models (LLMs) that utilize a knowledge graph. In its current implementation, it constitutes the core component of the Ariadne agent, which is designed to navigate text-based games within the TextWorld framework. This agent significantly outperforms all established baselines in text-based game scenarios and demonstrates robust scalability in larger environments. Detailed information about the AriGraph and the Ariadne agent can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062).
