You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a toothbrush, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.


Your task is to clean the house by locating and taking items that are out of place and returning them to their proper locations in the house.
