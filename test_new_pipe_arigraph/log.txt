An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

Observation: 

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

An open fridge is in the corner. The fridge contains a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a corridor. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open screen door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You see a BBQ.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.
