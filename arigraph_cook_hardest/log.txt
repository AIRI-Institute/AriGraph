-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Observation:

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Observation:

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Ah, the pantry. This is some kind of pantry, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ.

There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Navigation step: 2
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Navigation step: 1
Observation: 

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.
