You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a Bathroom. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. The toilet is typical. On the toilet you can see a toilet paper and a sleeping lamp. You can see a bathroom sink. On the bathroom sink you can see a toothbrush and a deodorant. What's that over there? It looks like it's a towel rack. The towel rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is an elegant table runner on the floor.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You can see a dining table. The dining table is typical. On the dining table you see a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. On the cook table you make out a business suit.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. On the cook table you make out a dirty plate.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. On the cook table you make out a salt and papper shakers.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed dishwasher in the corner. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Well, here we are in a Kids Room. Let's see what's in here.

You make out an opened toy storage cabinet nearby. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy sword and a toy car. Were you looking for a study table? Because look over there, it's a study table. On the study table you can see a felt tip pens and a school notebooks. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kids bed. The kids bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You make out an opened toy storage cabinet nearby. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy sword and a toy car. Were you looking for a study table? Because look over there, it's a study table. On the study table you can see a felt tip pens. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kids bed. The kids bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see a sleeping lamp and an alarm clock. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. The refrigerator contains a raw meat, a milk and a cheese. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Well, here we are in a Kids Room. Let's see what's in here.

You make out an opened toy storage cabinet nearby. The toy storage cabinet contains a toy sword and a toy car. Were you looking for a study table? Because look over there, it's a study table. On the study table you can see a school notebooks and a felt tip pens. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kids bed. The kids bed is normal.

You are in a Master Bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see an opened ordinary looking wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe contains a business suit and an evening dress. You can see a king size bed. The king size bed is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a bedside table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bedside table is typical. On the bedside table you see an alarm clock and a sleeping lamp. Huh, weird.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You find yourself in a Kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out an opened dishwasher in the corner. The dishwasher contains a dirty plate, so there's that. You see a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room for a cook table, and you find a cook table. On the cook table you make out a business suit.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
