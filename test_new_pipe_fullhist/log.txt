-= Dining Room =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a Dining Room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a toothbrush, a centerpiece, a candles and a salt and papper shakers. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.


Your task is to clean the house by locating and taking items that are out of place and returning them to their proper locations in the house.

-= Master Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a Master Bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a wardrobe. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a king size bed. On the king size bed you can make out a wet towel. You can make out a bedside table. On the bedside table you can make out an alarm clock and a bed lamp. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
