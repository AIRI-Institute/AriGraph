On the counter you can make out a tomato and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.
