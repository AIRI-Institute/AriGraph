- Direct Action: If you know what you need to do to advance, focus on those actions. Ignore distractions or "noise" that don't contribute to your goal.
- Exploration and Learning: When you're unsure of your next steps or need to acquire new knowledge (this includes discovering items, places, and creatures), shift your focus to exploring. This approach helps you uncover new options and solutions.
- Avoid Repetition: As you explore, try not to revisit the same locations or repeat actions unless necessary. Your aim should be to uncover new areas and possibilities.
- Knowledge Graph: All the details and information you gather will be added to a "knowledge graph". Think of this as your game's database which provide you with necessary information. Expanding this graph through exploration will significantly aid in making informed decisions as the game progresses.'''


prompt_extracting_items = '''Based on the information provided, your task is to filter and identify objects, locations, or elements that are relevant to your specified goal from the current situation. Be sure to include objects directly connected to your goal and exclude any that are not pertinent. The objects you list should be succinctly named, using no more than three words per item. Feel free to add objects that relative to game rules (for example: "search", "new data", "environment", "game", "action")

Here's how you should structure your response:

Previous observations: {observations}
Current observation: {observation}
Your goal: {goal}
Given this setup, extract and list only the objects from the current situation that are relevant to achieving your goal.

Example:

If the information provided is:

Previous observations: ["You are in the kitchen with exits to west and north"]
Current observation: "You are in the hall with a chest and a table"
Your goal: "Find a path to the rabbit which lives in the cabinet"
Then your response should be:

Crucial things: ["kitchen", "hall", "rabbit", "cabinet", "search", "moving"]

Remember, your response must adhere to this format:
Crucial things: [item1, item2, ...]

# For extraction triplets from observation
prompt_extraction = '''Extracting Information:

- Your main job is to process game observations and extract meaningful data from them.
- This data should be formatted as triplets: "subject, relation, object".
- A subject is the main entity (e.g., "Albert Einstein").
- A relation describes the connection between the subject and the object (e.g., "born in").
- An object is what the subject is related to (e.g., "Germany").

## Formatting Triplets:

- Triplets must be simple and to the point.
- If any information is complex, break it down into simpler, separate triplets.
- Avoid including collective entities or long phrases as objects.
- Standardize similar terms to maintain uniformity.

## Handling States and Properties:

- If an entity simply possesses a state or feature, use "itself" as the object in your triplet (e.g., "Door, opened, itself").

## Maintaining Entity Consistency:

- Ensure that you consistently reference entities using the most complete and clear identifier, even if they are mentioned in different ways throughout the text.

## Extracting Meta Information and Insights:

- Besides observations, extract information about game rules and unique qualities of the game environment that might affect gameplay.
- Concentrate on game properties that are unexpected for you.
- You can also extract your insights which are based on game observation.
- You shouldn't extract all valid actions, extract only needful from its.

A practical example from the text "Albert Einstein, born in Germany, is known for developing the theory of relativity" becomes:
"Albert Einstein, country, Germany; Albert Einstein, developed, Theory of relativity".
A practical example from the text "There is a small room. Action that led to this: turn on flashlight. \n Previous observation: You are at dark." becomes:
"light, can provide, new data".
A practical example from the text "I can't understand yout command. Action that lead to this: use key and explore chest" becomes:
"use, incorrect, action; explore, incorrect, action; game, can't perform, several actions".

This approach aims to make complex text data easily understandable and useful, particularly for creating knowledge graphs that enhance comprehension and future use.
Please, extract triplets from this game state following the instructions above:
####
Observation: {observation}
Previous observations: {observations}
####
Triplets must be extracted in format: subject_1, relation_1, object_1; subject_2, relation_2, object_2; ...

Based on the information provided above, your task is to set a clear and actionable goal for the next few steps in the game. This goal should be beneficial, directly contribute to winning the game, and be achievable given the current game context. Examples of appropriate goals include "Explore the east exit from the Kitchen", "Open the golden chest", "Find a path to the library", "Descend to the cellar", and "Deliver the red book to the home". Each of these goals could be relevant in different scenarios.

Please define a goal considering the current situation in the game.

# For graph updating
prompt_refining = """The triplets denote facts about the environment where the player moves. The player takes actions and the environment changes, so some triplets from the list of existing triplets should be replaced with one of the new triplets. For example, the door was previously opened and now it is closed, so the triplet "Door, state, opened" should be replaced with the triplet "Door, state, closed". Another example, the player took the item from the locker and the triplet "Item, is in, Locker" should be replaced with the triplet "Player, has, Item".
First example of existing triplets: "Golden locker, state, open"; "Room K, is west of, Room I".
First example of new triplets: "Golden locker, state, closed"; "Room K, is west of, Room I".
